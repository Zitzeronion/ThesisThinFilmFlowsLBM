Hello everybody :wave:

My name is Stefan and I'm a researcher at [Roskilde University](https://forskning.ruc.dk/en/persons/zitz).
This repository houses my dissertation, my research focus is fluid dynamics or to be exact computational fluid dynamics. 
The thesis is made of two parts. 
The first part is a somewhat lengthy introduction where I try to say something smart about fluid dynamics and the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), which is a model to put the continuous Navier-Stokes equation into a discrete form so that a computer can solve them.
The second part of the thesis are the papers I have written.
In the [first paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.04312) the numerical realization of the problem shown, following a test driven approach and functional computing style.
The [second paper](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.100.033313) introduces the neat tricks we had to come up with to push the shallow water equations into the thin film framework.
In the [third paper](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.104.034801) we were looking at a rather complex problem and did some cool work both, theoretically and numerically.
The second part is closed with my [forth paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09770), actually the one I am kind a proud of. We could find a novel morphological transition and found even a simple theoretical argument to motivate that transition.

After this I have added a short conclusion and some outlook.
