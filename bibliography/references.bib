  abstract = { The laws of wetting are well known for drops on rigid surfaces but change dramatically when the substrate is soft and deformable. The combination of wetting and the intricacies of soft polymeric interfaces have provided many rich examples of fluid–structure interactions, both in terms of phenomenology and from a fundamental perspective. In this review we discuss experimental and theoretical progress on the statics and dynamics of soft wetting. In this context we critically revisit the foundations of capillarity, such as the nature of solid surface tension, the microscopic mechanics near the contact line, and the dissipative mechanisms that lead to unexpected spreading dynamics. }

abstract = {Domain decomposition approaches require efficient interface techniques when fluids and structures are solved in independent computational domains for aerospace applications. Fluid/structure interfacing techniques for solutions from equations based on low-fidelity approaches that are in the linear domain are well advanced and are incorporated in production codes NASTRAN and ASTROS. However, for computations involving high-fidelity equations such as the Navier–Stokes for fluids and finite elements for structures, interface approaches are still under development. This paper provides a technical overview of methods for interfacing flow solutions from the Euler/Navier–Stokes methods with structural solutions using modal/finite-element methods. Validity of the methods is supported by previously presented results.}

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel approach to model the fluid/solid interaction forces in a direct solver of the Navier–Stokes equations based on the volume of fluid interface tracking method. The key ingredient of the model is the explicit inclusion of the fluid/solid interaction forces into the governing equations. We show that the interaction forces lead to a partial wetting condition and in particular to a natural definition of the equilibrium contact angle. We present two numerical methods to discretize the interaction forces that enter the model; these two approaches differ in complexity and convergence. To validate the computational framework, we consider the application of these models to simulate two-dimensional drops at equilibrium, as well as drop spreading. We demonstrate that the model, by including the underlying physics, captures contact line dynamics for arbitrary contact angles. More generally, the approach permits novel means to study contact lines, as well as a diverse range of phenomena that previously could not be addressed in direct simulations.}

abstract = {Abstract The wetting of deformable elastic structures has been recently shown to comprise a rich variety of new physical phenomena (stick-slip motion, durotaxis, Shuttleworth effect, etc.) whose fundamental understanding demands for numerical simulation tools. In this article, we develop a novel unified model and numerical method for this problem. As special features, the method includes exact incompressibility and a linear monolithic assembly of the Navier-Stokes and Cahn-Hilliard equations which stabilizes dominant surface tension at small interface lengths. Also, solid viscosity is included which offers the opportunity to simulate the surfing behavior of droplets on viscoelastic substrates for the first time. We show that the method is highly accurate and more robust than most previous approaches and illustrate its potential by numerical simulation examples.},

abstract  ="The surfactant lining the walls of the alveoli in the lungs increases pulmonary compliance and prevents collapse of the lung at the end of expiration. In premature born infants{,} surfactant deficiency causes problems{,} and lung surfactant replacements are instilled to facilitate breathing. These pulmonary surfactants{,} which form complex structured fluid–fluid interfaces{,} need to spread with great efficiency and once in the alveolus they have to form a thin stable film. In the present work{,} we investigate the mechanisms affecting the stability of surfactant-laden thin films during spreading{,} using drainage flows from a hemispherical dome. Three commercial lung surfactant replacements Survanta{,} Curosurf and Infasurf{,} along with the phospholipid dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC){,} are used. The surface of the dome can be covered with human alveolar epithelial cells and experiments are conducted at the physiological temperature. Drainage is slowed down due to the presence of all the different lung surfactant replacements and therefore the thin films show enhanced stability. However{,} a scaling analysis combined with visualization experiments demonstrates that different mechanisms are involved. For Curosurf and Infasurf{,} Marangoni stresses are essential to impart stability and interfacial shear rheology does not play a role{,} in agreement with what is observed for simple surfactants. Survanta{,} which was historically the first natural surfactant used{,} is rheologically active. For DPPC the dilatational properties play a role. Understanding these different modes of stabilization for natural surfactants can benefit the design of effective synthetic surfactant replacements for treating infant and adult respiratory disorders."}

abstract = {The present work aims at examining nonlinear effects on film rupture by investigating the stability of thin films to finite amplitude disturbances. The dynamics of the liquid film is formulated using the Navier-Stokes equations augmented by a body force describing the London/van der Waals attractions. The liquid film is assumed to be charge neutralized, nondraining, and laterally unbounded. A nonlinear evolution equation is derived for h(x, t), the film thickness. This strongly nonlinear partial differential equation is solved by numerical methods as part of an initial-value problem for periodic boundary conditions in x, the lateral space dimension. Given this model, one obtains true rupture in the sense that the film thickness becomes zero in a finite time. The results reveal rupture characteristics and effects of nonlinearities on the rupture properties.}

The ability of this device to coat a range of film thicknesses at the same coating speed is traced to the freedom of the two free surfaces to adopt any curvature within certain limits. The observed limitations on operating conditions for this coater are explained by the failure of the desired steady-state to exist for all values of the operating parameters. The parameter bounds within which the device can coat a uniform liquid layer are predicted quantitatively. Some analyses of dip coating are reviewed in the light of the present work.}

abstract = {A method of calculation is introduced that allows the simulation of the time-dependent three-dimensional motion of liquid droplets on solid substrates for systems exhibiting finite equilibrium contact angles. The contact angle is a prescribed function of position on the substrate. An evolution equation is presented, using the lubrication approximation, that includes viscous, capillary, disjoining, and gravitational forces. Motion to and from dry substrate regions is made possible by use of a thin energetically stable wetting layer. Axisymmetric spreading on a uniform substrate is calculated, and it is found, in agreement with reported experiments, that spreading rates are independent of the contact angle until the drop has almost stabilized. We simulate motion on a heterogeneous substrate composed of two different materials having widely different contact angles. Motion proceeds in an almost discontinuous fashion as the initial droplet breaks up into smaller pieces through the action of the wetting forces. Various forms of the disjoining energy functional are employed; the particular choice is found to have only a limited quantitative effect of the drop dynamics. Experimental observations confirm the basic features of the simulation, although a time-scale correction needs to be applied.}

Starting with the classical potential flow theory for moving contact surfaces, the discussion extends to various fluid systems describing inhomogeneous, viscous, compressible, and isobaric flows. Thereby an overview on the major stability issues under a broad variety of physical conditions can be given. In particular, the stability analysis is addressed to layered materials in plane and spherical geometries under various dynamical conditions, to inhomogeneous media with variable gradients and different boundary conditions, to viscous boundary layers, compressible atmospheres, and to stationary ablation fronts in laser-driven plasma experiments. The stability theory is further extended to the nonlinear stage of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability and to a discussion of bubble dynamics in two and three dimensions for closed and open bubble domains. For this purpose simple flow models are studied that can describe essential features of bubble rise and bubble growth in buoyancy-driven mixing layers."

We propose a new numerical solution to the problem. Then, we discuss further developments: for liquids of low viscosity, it is shown that above a threshold in capillary number, the film is thickened because of inertia. A simple scaling argument is proposed for predicting the location of the threshold."

Despite the excellent barrier properties provided by these materials, all published data show some residual permeation, even when the barrier coatings are relatively thick (≥70 nm). This residual permeation is attributed to the presence of microscopic defects in the coatings. In this article we present new techniques, based mainly on reactive ion etching in oxygen plasma, to render visible micrometer- or sub-micrometer-sized defects in transparent ceramic films on polymers. These techniques can be used to visualize and better understand the origins of defects in these coatings on a microscopic scale, as well as for mapping and counting defect density on a macroscopic scale (tens of cm2 or more)."

Photochromic molecules have been studied for their characteristic color changes. Although the importance in this line has not dimmed, other powerful areas have emerged in the last two or three decades. Much more attention has been drawn to light induced motions triggered by photoreactions utilizing molecular and polymer assemblies. Probably, this field is one of the most developing areas in advanced soft material research. This review article mainly deals with azobenzene and diarylethene as the photochroms, and systematically introduces light triggered dynamic processes taking place at interfaces. In terms of the feature size, the systems at interfaces, mesoscopic and microscopic level materials are particularly highlighted. Molecular design and understanding of interfaces are the key to realize smart motility properties in molecular and polymer assemblies. }

When a liquid droplet several millimeters in diameter was placed on a substrate surface modified with a calix[4]resorcinarene derivative having photochromic azobenzene units, asymmetrical photoirradiation caused a gradient in surface free energy due to the photoisomerization of surface azobenzenes, leading to the directional motion of the droplet. The direction and velocity of the motion were tunable by varying the direction and steepness of the gradient in light intensity. The light-driven motion of a fluid substance in a surface-modified glass tube suggests potential applicability to microscale chemical process systems. }

Standard photolithographic techniques are used to obtain this precise surface-feature patterning. Positive photoresists, S1813 and AZ4620, are selected to mask the surface, and a mixture of BCl3 and Cl2 gases is used to perform the etching. Experimental data show that a droplet placed on the micro-grooved aluminum surface using a micro-syringe exhibits an increased apparent contact angle, and for droplets condensed on these etched surfaces, more than a 50$\%$ reduction in the volume needed for the onset of droplet sliding is manifest. No chemical surface treatment is necessary to achieve this water repellency; it is accomplished solely by an anisotropic surface morphology that manipulates droplet geometry and creates and exploits discontinuities in the three-phase contact line. These micro-structured surfaces are proposed for use in a broad range of air-cooling applications, where the management of condensate and defrost liquid on the heat transfer surface is essential to the energy-efficient operation of the machine.}

	abstract = {Wetting and dewetting are both fundamental modes of motion of liquids on solid surfaces. They are critically important for processes in biology, chemistry, and engineering, such as drying, coating, and lubrication. However, recent progress in wetting, which has led to new fields such as superhydrophobicity and liquid marbles, has not been matched by dewetting. A significant problem has been the inability to study the model system of a uniform film dewetting from a nonwetting surface to a single macroscopic droplet{\textemdash}a barrier that does not exist for the reverse wetting process of a droplet spreading into a film. We report the dewetting of a dielectrophoresis-induced film into a single equilibrium droplet. The emergent picture of the full dewetting dynamics is of an initial regime, where a liquid rim recedes at constant speed and constant dynamic contact angle, followed by a relatively short exponential relaxation of a spherical cap shape. This sharply contrasts with the reverse wetting process, where a spreading droplet follows a smooth sequence of spherical cap shapes. Complementary numerical simulations and a hydrodynamic model reveal a local dewetting mechanism driven by the equilibrium contact angle, where contact line slip dominates the dewetting dynamics. Our conclusions can be used to understand a wide variety of processes involving liquid dewetting, such as drop rebound, condensation, and evaporation. In overcoming the barrier to studying single film-to-droplet dewetting, our results provide new approaches to fluid manipulation and uses of dewetting, such as inducing films of prescribed initial shapes and slip-controlled liquid retraction.},

The models are obtained as asymptotic limits of the Navier-Stokes equations with the Navier-slip boundary condition for different orders of magnitude for the slip-length parameter. Specifically, the influence of slip on the dewetting behavior of fluids on hydrophobic substrates is investigated here. Matched asymptotics are used to describe the dynamic profiles for dewetting films and comparison is given with computational simulations. The motion of the dewetting front shows transitions from being nearly linear in time for no-slip to t2/3 as the slip is increased. For much larger slip lengths the front motion appears to become linear again. Correspondingly, the dewetting profiles undergo a transition from oscillatory to monotone decay into the uniform film layer for large slip. Increasing the slip further, to very large values, is associated with an increasing degree of asymmetry in the structure of the dewetting ridge profile},

abstract = "Movement of the contact line over a solid surface violates the adherence, or “no slip,” boundary condition which is otherwise obeyed by flowing liquids. A flat fluid interface moving steadily over a flat solid is modeled with the creeping flow approximation, which turns out to be self-consistent. Adherence is required except at the contact line itself. Though the velocity field appears to be realistic, stresses and viscous dissipation are found to increase without bound at the contact line. The way the hydrodynamic model breaks down suggests that in reality there may be steep gradients, rheological anomalies, and discontinuous processes around the contact line. Slip and the role of long-range forces are explored with the aid of the lubrication flow approximation."

abstract = "Experimental results are reported on the spreading of a nonvolatile liquid drop on a horizontal smooth solid surface with negligible effects of gravity and inertia. The liquid is strongly wetting to the solid with an advancing static contact angle θs less than 1°. The drop radius R, the apex height H, and the advancing dynamic contact angle θ were measured as functions of time t. For each drop the data of R-t, H-t, and θ-t follow different power laws, αtβ. The values of α and β for R are close to those predicted by Starov (J. Colloid USSR (Engl. Trans)45(6), 1009 (1983)) for a spreading drop under the action of capillary and viscous forces. But the data for H and θ show less satisfactory agreement with the predictions. For θ two different quantities are measured: θ0 is the angle between the tangent to the drop edge and the solid surface and θRH is the angle calculated from R and H for a spherical drop. The measured θ range from 1.5 to 17°, for capillary number C from 1.8 × 10−6 to 3.3 × 10−4. Correlation by a least-squares fit for the θ-C data gives θ0 = 222C0.353and θRH = 242C0.353 (both in degrees). Good agreement is found between our θ-C data and correlations with those presented in the literature for experiments in a capillary tube (R. L. Hoffman, J. Colloid Interface Sci.50, 228 (1975); T. S. Jiang et al., J. Colloid Interface Sci.69, 74 (1979) and in parallel plate (C. G. Ngan and E. B. Dussan V, J. Fluid Mech.118, 27 (1982)) for a wide range of θ and C. This suggests that, when the capillary and viscous forces are the only dominant factors, θ is independent of the experimental geometry. And hence the correlations can be used to estimate θ when a nonvolatile liquid displaces air with θs < 1° under a dynamically similar condition."

It is shown that the drop profiles can be predicted and that this leads to a relation between the edge velocity and the maximum slope, which occurs at an inflection point close to the edge. This relation leads to others governing the variation of drop size and slope with time. The predictions are compared with experiment, using silicone oils, and good agreement obtained. The lubrication approximation theory gives no solution for thicknesses below a value varying from 2 to 9*10-8 m at the drop edge. At thicknesses of this order, or possibly even larger, other effects become important, and some observations on edge behaviour are included.}

	abstract = {The basic mechanisms which take place during the displacement of immiscible fluids in porous media have been observed in micromodels and have been modelled. At the pore level, in drainage, the invading fluid chooses the largest throat. In imbibition, the displacement depends on the local geometry. For a large pore-to-throat ratio (aspect ratio), the main mechanism is the collapse of the invading fluid in the smallest channel, without entering the pore. For a small aspect ratio, the wetting fluid invades the pore first, and then the adjacent channels. From observations at the pore level, the author has modelled the displacement on a large scale in some extreme cases by using statistical theories. The different behaviours are then displayed as domains in three phase diagrams: one for drainage and two for imbibition (large and small aspect ratios). At a high rate, when viscous forces are dominant, all the diagrams show a stable domain (described by anti-DLA) and a viscous fingering domain (DLA). In drainage, low capillary numbers lead to capillary fingering represented by invasion percolation. In imbibition, the capillary domain is described either by a compact cluster growth (small aspect ratio) or percolation theory (large aspect ratio). In addition the possibility of flow by film along the roughness of the walls leads to disconnected structures.}

	abstract = {Dewetting is the hydrodynamic process where a uniform layer of liquid destabilizes and decays into distinct patterns of stationary droplets by virtue of interfacial and intermolecular energies. These patterns can now be predicted theoretically, and their evolution can be followed numerically in striking similarity to experimental results. The droplet arrays observed during the quasistatic evolution are generated by two distinct types of instabilities: droplet shedding of moving liquid rims and satellite droplet pinch-off during the decay of stationary ridges. The mechanism causing the emergence of different droplet patterns is the dissipation at the liquid{\textendash}solid interface modeled by an effective Navier slip.Thin polymer films on hydrophobic substrates are susceptible to rupture and hole formation. This, in turn, initiates a complex dewetting process, which ultimately leads to characteristic droplet patterns. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the type of droplet pattern depends on the specific interfacial condition between the polymer and the substrate. Predicting the morphological evolution over long timescales and on the different length scales involved is a major computational challenge. In this study, a highly adaptive numerical scheme is presented, which allows for following the dewetting process deep into the nonlinear regime of the model equations and captures the complex dynamics, including the shedding of droplets. In addition, our numerical results predict the previously unknown shedding of satellite droplets during the destabilization of liquid ridges that form during the late stages of the dewetting process. While the formation of satellite droplets is well known in the context of elongating fluid filaments and jets, we show here that, for dewetting liquid ridges, this property can be dramatically altered by the interfacial condition between polymer and substrate, namely slip. This work shows how dissipative processes can be used to systematically tune the formation of patterns.},

abstract="Thin liquid films are ubiquitous in natural phenomena and technological applications. They have been extensively studied via deterministic hydrodynamic equations, but thermal fluctuations often play a crucial role that needs to be understood. An example of this is dewetting, which involves the rupture of a thin liquid film and the formation of droplets. Such a process is thermally activated and requires fluctuations to be taken into account self-consistently. In this work we present an analytical and numerical study of a stochastic thin-film equation derived from first principles. Following a brief review of the derivation, we scrutinise the behaviour of the equation in the limit of perfectly correlated noise along the wall-normal direction, as opposed to the perfectly uncorrelated limit studied by Gr{\"u}n et al. (J Stat Phys 122(6):1261--1291, 2006). We also present a numerical scheme based on a spectral collocation method, which is then utilised to simulate the stochastic thin-film equation. This scheme seems to be very convenient for numerical studies of the stochastic thin-film equation, since it makes it easier to select the frequency modes of the noise (following the spirit of the long-wave approximation). With our numerical scheme we explore the fluctuating dynamics of the thin film and the behaviour of its free energy in the vicinity of rupture. Finally, we study the effect of the noise intensity on the rupture time, using a large number of sample paths as compared to previous studies.",

The lattice gas method, regarded as the simplest microscopic and kinetic approach which generates meaningful macroscopic dynamics, is fully parallel and can, as a result, be easily programmed on parallel machines. In this paper, we introduce the basic principles of the lattice gas method and the lattice Boltzmann method, their numerical implementations and applications to chemically reacting systems. Comparisons of the lattice Boltzmann method with the lattice gas technique and other traditional numerical schemes, including the finite difference scheme and the pseudo-spectral method, for solving the Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic fluid flows will be discussed. Recent developments of the lattice gas and the lattice Boltzmann method and their applications to pattern formation in chemical reaction-diffusion systems, multiphase fluid flows and polymeric dynamics will be presented."

  abstract = {Summary Proper approximation of the force terms, especially the bed slope term, is of crucial importance to simulating shallow water flows in lattice Boltzmann (LB) models. However, there is little discussion on the schemes of adding force terms to LB models for shallow water equations (SWEs). In this study, we evaluate the performance of forcing schemes coupled with different LB models (LABSWE and MLBSWE) in simulating shallow water flows over complex topography and try to find out their intrinsic characteristics and applicability. Three cases are adopted for evaluation, including a stationary case, a one-dimensional tidal wave flow over an irregular bed, and a steady flow over a two-dimensional seamount. The simulating results are compared with analytical solutions or the results produced by the finite difference method. For LABSWE, all the forcing schemes, except for the weighting factor method, fail to produce accurate solutions for the test cases; this is probably due to the mismatch between the bed slope term in source terms and the quadratic depth term of the equilibrium distribution functions in these forcing schemes. For MLBSWE, all the forcing schemes are capable of simulating flows over the complex topography accurately; furthermore, those schemes taking into account the collision effect τ to eliminate the momentum induced by forces provide more accurate solutions with quicker convergence as the lattice size decreases. In this view, MLBSWE can bring more flexibility in treating the force terms and thus can be a better tool to simulate shallow water flows over complex topography in practical application.},

When the volume of the moving upper layer is sufficiently small, the motionless lower layer outcrops over a broad area of the northern wind gyre, and the pattern of separated and isolated western boundary currents agrees with the theory of Veronis (1973). Because planetary geostrophic dynamics omit inertia, lattice Boltzmann solutions of the planetary geostrophic equations do not require a lattice with the high degree of symmetry needed to correctly represent the Reynolds stress. This property gives planetary geostrophic dynamics a significant computational advantage over the primitive equations, especially in three dimensions.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY In this paper the dynamics of a two-layered liquid, made of two immiscible shallow-layers of different density, has been investigated within the framework of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The LBM developed in this paper for the two-layered, shallow-water flow has been obtained considering two separate sets of LBM equations, one for each layer. The coupling terms between the two sets have been defined as external forces, acted on one layer by the other. Results obtained from the LBM developed in this paper are compared with numerical results obtained solving the two-layered, shallow-water equations, with experimental and other numerical results published in literature. The results are interesting. First, the numerical results obtained by the LBM and by the shallow-water model can be considered as equivalent. Second, the LBM developed in this paper is able to simulate motion conditions on nonflat topography. Third, the agreement between the LBM (and also shallow-water model) numerical results and the experimental results is good when the evolution of the flow does not depend on the viscosity, that is, during the initial phase of the flow, dominated by gravity and inertia forces. When the viscous forces dominate the evolution of the flow the agreement between numerical and experimental results depends strongly on the viscosity; it is good if the numerical LBM viscosity has the same order of magnitude of the liquid's kinematic viscosity.

In addition to the classical layer depth and velocity in shallow models, our system describes also the evolution of two components of the stress. It has an intrinsic energy equation. The mathematical properties of the model are established, an important feature being the non-convexity of the physically relevant energy with respect to conservative variables, but the convexity with respect to the physically relevant pseudo-conservative variables. Numerical illustrations are given, based on a suitable well-balanced finite-volume discretization involving an approximate Riemann solver. }

A new formulation of the viscous effects, consistent with a previous one-dimensional analysis, is obtained. Finally, we propose some simple numerical experiments in order to validate the proposed model.}

abstract="The giant tsunami that occurred in the Indian Ocean on 26th December 2004 draws attention to this natural phenomenon. The given course of lectures deals with the physics of the tsunami wave propagation from the source to the coast. Briefly, the geographical distribution of the tsunamis is described and physical mechanisms of their origin are discussed. Simplified robust formulas for the source parameters (dimension and height) are given for tsunamis of different origin. It is shown that the shallow-water theory is an adequate model to describe the tsunamis of the seismic origin; meanwhile for the tsunamis of the landslide or explosion origin (volcanoes, asteroid impact) various theories (from linear dispersive to nonlinear shallow-water equations) can be applied. The applicability of the existing theories to describe the tsunami wave propagation, refraction, transformation and climbing on the coast is demonstrated. Nonlinear-dispersive effects including the role of the solitons are discussed. The practical usage of the tsunami modeling for the tsunami forecasting and tsunami risk evaluation is described. The results of the numerical simulations of the two global tsunamis in the Indian Ocean induced by the catastrophic Krakatau eruption in 1883 and the strongest North Sumatra earthquake in 2004 are given.",

When these two configurations are very close to each other, classical solutions do exist, as shown by Ebin and Marsden. However, Shnirelman found a class of data (essentially 2D in the sense that they trivially depend on the vertical coordinate) for which there cannot be any classical minimizer. For such data, generalized solutions can be shown to exist, as a substitute for classical solutions. These generalized solutions have unusual features that look highly unphysical (in particular, different fluid parcels can cross at the same point and at the same time), but the pressure field, which does not depend on the vertical coordinate, is well and uniquely defined. In the present paper, we show that these generalized solutions are actually quite conventional in the sense they obey, up to a suitable change of variable, a well-known variant (widely used for geophysical flows) of the 3D Euler equations, for which the vertical acceleration is neglected according to the so-called hydrostatic approximation.},

The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.}

The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.}

abstract = { It has already been asserted, by Mr. Monge and others, that the phenomena of capillary tubes are referable to the cohesive attraction of the superficial particles only of the fluids em­ployed, and that the surfaces must consequently be formed into curves of the nature of lintearias, which are supposed to be the results of a uniform tension of a surface, resisting the pressure of a fluid, either uniform, or varying according to a given law. Segner, who appears to have been the first that maintained a similar opinion, has shown in what manner the principle may be deduced from the doctrine of attraction, but his demonstration is complicated, and not perfectly satisfactory; and in applying the law to the forms of drops, he has neglected to consider the very material effects of the double curvature, which is evidently the cause of the want of a perfect coinci­dence of some of his experiments with his theory. Since the time of Segner, little has been done in investigating accurately and in detail the various consequences of the principle. It will perhaps be most agreeable to the experimental phi­losopher, although less consistent with the strict course of logical argument, to proceed in the first place to the comparison of this theory with the phenomena, and to inquire afterwards for its foundation in the ultimate properties of matter. But it is necessary to premise one observation, which appears to be new, and which is equally consistent with theory and with experiment; that is, that for each combination of a solid and a fluid, there is an appropriate angle of contact between the surfaces of the fluid, exposed to the air, and to the solid. This angle, for glass and water, and in all cases where a solid is perfectly wetted by a fluid, is evanescent: for glass and mer­cury, it is about 140°, in common temperatures, and when the mercury is moderately clean. }
