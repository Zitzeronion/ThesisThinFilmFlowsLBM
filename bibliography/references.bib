abstract  ="By utilizing a proposed analytical model in combination with the phase-field method{,} we present a comprehensive study on the effect of chemical patterns on equilibrium droplet morphologies. Here{,} three influencing factors{,} the droplet sizes{,} contact angles{,} and the ratios of the hydrophilic area to the hydrophobic area{,} are contemplated. In the analytical model{,} chemical heterogeneities are described by different non-linear functions. By tuning these functions and the related parameters{,} the analytical model is capable of calculating the energy landscapes of the system. The chemically patterned surfaces display complex energy landscapes with chemical-heterogeneity-induced local minima{,} which correspond to the equilibrium morphologies of the droplets. Phase-field (PF) simulations are accordingly conducted and compared with the predicted equilibrium morphologies. In addition{,} we propose a modified Cassie–Baxter (CB) model to delineate the equilibrium droplet shapes. In contrast to the classic CB model{,} our extension is not only restricted to the shape with a spherical cap. Both the energy landscape method and the modified CB model are demonstrated to have a good agreement with the PF simulations."}

abstract = {The present work aims at examining nonlinear effects on film rupture by investigating the stability of thin films to finite amplitude disturbances. The dynamics of the liquid film is formulated using the Navier-Stokes equations augmented by a body force describing the London/van der Waals attractions. The liquid film is assumed to be charge neutralized, nondraining, and laterally unbounded. A nonlinear evolution equation is derived for h(x, t), the film thickness. This strongly nonlinear partial differential equation is solved by numerical methods as part of an initial-value problem for periodic boundary conditions in x, the lateral space dimension. Given this model, one obtains true rupture in the sense that the film thickness becomes zero in a finite time. The results reveal rupture characteristics and effects of nonlinearities on the rupture properties.}

Despite the excellent barrier properties provided by these materials, all published data show some residual permeation, even when the barrier coatings are relatively thick (≥70 nm). This residual permeation is attributed to the presence of microscopic defects in the coatings. In this article we present new techniques, based mainly on reactive ion etching in oxygen plasma, to render visible micrometer- or sub-micrometer-sized defects in transparent ceramic films on polymers. These techniques can be used to visualize and better understand the origins of defects in these coatings on a microscopic scale, as well as for mapping and counting defect density on a macroscopic scale (tens of cm2 or more)."

	abstract = {A technique for fabricating micropatterned aluminum surfaces with parallel grooves 30 µm wide and tens of microns in depth is described. Standard photolithographic techniques are used to obtain this precise surface-feature patterning. Positive photoresists, S1813 and AZ4620, are selected to mask the surface, and a mixture of BCl3 and Cl2 gases is used to perform the etching. Experimental data show that a droplet placed on the micro-grooved aluminum surface using a micro-syringe exhibits an increased apparent contact angle, and for droplets condensed on these etched surfaces, more than a 50$\%$ reduction in the volume needed for the onset of droplet sliding is manifest. No chemical surface treatment is necessary to achieve this water repellency; it is accomplished solely by an anisotropic surface morphology that manipulates droplet geometry and creates and exploits discontinuities in the three-phase contact line. These micro-structured surfaces are proposed for use in a broad range of air-cooling applications, where the management of condensate and defrost liquid on the heat transfer surface is essential to the energy-efficient operation of the machine.}

The models are obtained as asymptotic limits of the Navier-Stokes equations with the Navier-slip boundary condition for different orders of magnitude for the slip-length parameter. Specifically, the influence of slip on the dewetting behavior of fluids on hydrophobic substrates is investigated here. Matched asymptotics are used to describe the dynamic profiles for dewetting films and comparison is given with computational simulations. The motion of the dewetting front shows transitions from being nearly linear in time for no-slip to t2/3 as the slip is increased. For much larger slip lengths the front motion appears to become linear again. Correspondingly, the dewetting profiles undergo a transition from oscillatory to monotone decay into the uniform film layer for large slip. Increasing the slip further, to very large values, is associated with an increasing degree of asymmetry in the structure of the dewetting ridge profile},

  abstract = {Summary Proper approximation of the force terms, especially the bed slope term, is of crucial importance to simulating shallow water flows in lattice Boltzmann (LB) models. However, there is little discussion on the schemes of adding force terms to LB models for shallow water equations (SWEs). In this study, we evaluate the performance of forcing schemes coupled with different LB models (LABSWE and MLBSWE) in simulating shallow water flows over complex topography and try to find out their intrinsic characteristics and applicability. Three cases are adopted for evaluation, including a stationary case, a one-dimensional tidal wave flow over an irregular bed, and a steady flow over a two-dimensional seamount. The simulating results are compared with analytical solutions or the results produced by the finite difference method. For LABSWE, all the forcing schemes, except for the weighting factor method, fail to produce accurate solutions for the test cases; this is probably due to the mismatch between the bed slope term in source terms and the quadratic depth term of the equilibrium distribution functions in these forcing schemes. For MLBSWE, all the forcing schemes are capable of simulating flows over the complex topography accurately; furthermore, those schemes taking into account the collision effect τ to eliminate the momentum induced by forces provide more accurate solutions with quicker convergence as the lattice size decreases. In this view, MLBSWE can bring more flexibility in treating the force terms and thus can be a better tool to simulate shallow water flows over complex topography in practical application.},

abstract="The giant tsunami that occurred in the Indian Ocean on 26th December 2004 draws attention to this natural phenomenon. The given course of lectures deals with the physics of the tsunami wave propagation from the source to the coast. Briefly, the geographical distribution of the tsunamis is described and physical mechanisms of their origin are discussed. Simplified robust formulas for the source parameters (dimension and height) are given for tsunamis of different origin. It is shown that the shallow-water theory is an adequate model to describe the tsunamis of the seismic origin; meanwhile for the tsunamis of the landslide or explosion origin (volcanoes, asteroid impact) various theories (from linear dispersive to nonlinear shallow-water equations) can be applied. The applicability of the existing theories to describe the tsunami wave propagation, refraction, transformation and climbing on the coast is demonstrated. Nonlinear-dispersive effects including the role of the solitons are discussed. The practical usage of the tsunami modeling for the tsunami forecasting and tsunami risk evaluation is described. The results of the numerical simulations of the two global tsunamis in the Indian Ocean induced by the catastrophic Krakatau eruption in 1883 and the strongest North Sumatra earthquake in 2004 are given.",

abstract = { It has already been asserted, by Mr. Monge and others, that the phenomena of capillary tubes are referable to the cohesive attraction of the superficial particles only of the fluids em­ployed, and that the surfaces must consequently be formed into curves of the nature of lintearias, which are supposed to be the results of a uniform tension of a surface, resisting the pressure of a fluid, either uniform, or varying according to a given law. Segner, who appears to have been the first that maintained a similar opinion, has shown in what manner the principle may be deduced from the doctrine of attraction, but his demonstration is complicated, and not perfectly satisfactory; and in applying the law to the forms of drops, he has neglected to consider the very material effects of the double curvature, which is evidently the cause of the want of a perfect coinci­dence of some of his experiments with his theory. Since the time of Segner, little has been done in investigating accurately and in detail the various consequences of the principle. It will perhaps be most agreeable to the experimental phi­losopher, although less consistent with the strict course of logical argument, to proceed in the first place to the comparison of this theory with the phenomena, and to inquire afterwards for its foundation in the ultimate properties of matter. But it is necessary to premise one observation, which appears to be new, and which is equally consistent with theory and with experiment; that is, that for each combination of a solid and a fluid, there is an appropriate angle of contact between the surfaces of the fluid, exposed to the air, and to the solid. This angle, for glass and water, and in all cases where a solid is perfectly wetted by a fluid, is evanescent: for glass and mer­cury, it is about 140°, in common temperatures, and when the mercury is moderately clean. }

  abstract = {Abstract The development of multiphase liquid-liquid morphologies during mixing at small Reynolds numbers has been modeled. The mixing process is divided into (i) stretching of dispersed drops. (ii) breakup of the liquid threads formed, and (iii) coalescence of the final droplets upon collision. Rules and criteria of the distinct processes are presented and combined to a general 2-zone mixing model simplifying the flow field into a sequence of alternating “strong and weak zones.” In a “strong zone,” dispersed drops and threads are stretched unless their radius is too small; meanwhile, the stretching threads might break up into droplets. In the subsequent “weak zone,” the remaining threads may disintegrate while any drops present may coalesce. After passing a number of zones, stretching, breakup, and coalescence lead to a dynamic equilibrium that could be considered as the “final” morphology. Using the 2-zone mixing model, the influence of material parameters and processing conditions on the morphology has been studied. Interestingly, increasing either viscosity (dispersed or continuous phase) yields a finer morphology due to the delay of thread breakup, allowing for further stretching and suppression of coalescence.},

  abstract = {Mayonnaise a mixture of egg, vinegar, oil and spices is probably one of the oldest and most widely used sauces in the world today. Traditional mayonnaise is an oil-in-water emulsion despite containing 70–80\% fat. Careful mixing of the ingredients and the addition of minor constituents help to maintain a closely packed foam of oil droplets. Low-fat mayonnaises need additional ingredients to maintain their stability. Mayonnaise, in common with all high fat foods, is susceptible to spoilage due to auto-oxidation, its stability depending on the type of oil used. Salt, as well as being important in the development of the flavour and stability appears to influence the rate of oxidation of the oil in the emulsion. The characteristic flavour of mayonnaise is derived principally from the addition of mustard, which contains isothiocyanates. These isothiocyanates are stabilized in the aqueous solution by the addition of citric acid. An understanding of the physical and chemical processes involved in the formation of emulsions has allowed the manufacture of mayonnaise, which is much, more stable during long-term storage and the development of products which contain a greater range of novel flavours.}

abstract = {The spontaneous spreading (called superspreading) of aqueous trisiloxane ethoxylate surfactant solutions on hydrophobic solid surfaces is a fascinating phenomenon with several practical applications. For example, the ability of trisiloxane ethoxylate surfactants to enhance the spreading of spray solutions on waxy weed leaf surfaces, such as velvetleaf (Abutilion theophrasti), makes them excellent wetting agents for herbicide applications. The superspreading ability of silicone surfactants has been known for decades, but its mechanism is still not well understood. In this paper, we suggest that the spreading of trisiloxane ethoxylates is controlled by a surface tension gradient, which forms when a drop of surfactant solution is placed on a solid surface. The proposed model suggests that, as the spreading front stretches, the surface tension increases (the surfactant concentration becomes lower) at the front relative to the top of the droplet, thereby establishing a dynamic surface tension gradient. The driving force for spreading is due to the Marangoni effect, and our experiments showed that the higher the gradient, the faster the spreading. A simple model describing the phenomenon of superspreading is presented. We also suggest that the superspreading behavior of trisiloxane ethoxylates is a consequence of the molecular configuration at the air/water surface (i.e. small and compact hydrophobic part), as shown by molecular dynamics modeling. We also found that the aggregates and vesicles formed in trisiloxane solutions do not initiate the spreading process and therefore these structures are not a requirement for the superspreading process.}
