abstract = "Movement of the contact line over a solid surface violates the adherence, or “no slip,” boundary condition which is otherwise obeyed by flowing liquids. A flat fluid interface moving steadily over a flat solid is modeled with the creeping flow approximation, which turns out to be self-consistent. Adherence is required except at the contact line itself. Though the velocity field appears to be realistic, stresses and viscous dissipation are found to increase without bound at the contact line. The way the hydrodynamic model breaks down suggests that in reality there may be steep gradients, rheological anomalies, and discontinuous processes around the contact line. Slip and the role of long-range forces are explored with the aid of the lubrication flow approximation."

The LBM is especially useful for modeling complicated boundary conditions and multiphase interfaces. Recent extensions of this method are described, including simulations of fluid turbulence, suspension flows, and reaction diffusion systems. }

abstract = {We construct a lattice Boltzmann model of a single-layer, "reduced gravity" ocean in a square basin, with shallow water or planetary geostrophic dynamics, and boundary conditions of no slip or no stress. When the volume of the moving upper layer is sufficiently small, the motionless lower layer outcrops over a broad area of the northern wind gyre, and the pattern of separated and isolated western boundary currents agrees with the theory of Veronis (1973). Because planetary geostrophic dynamics omit inertia, lattice Boltzmann solutions of the planetary geostrophic equations do not require a lattice with the high degree of symmetry needed to correctly represent the Reynolds stress. This property gives planetary geostrophic dynamics a significant computational advantage over the primitive equations, especially in three dimensions.},
