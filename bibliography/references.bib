abstract  ="By utilizing a proposed analytical model in combination with the phase-field method{,} we present a comprehensive study on the effect of chemical patterns on equilibrium droplet morphologies. Here{,} three influencing factors{,} the droplet sizes{,} contact angles{,} and the ratios of the hydrophilic area to the hydrophobic area{,} are contemplated. In the analytical model{,} chemical heterogeneities are described by different non-linear functions. By tuning these functions and the related parameters{,} the analytical model is capable of calculating the energy landscapes of the system. The chemically patterned surfaces display complex energy landscapes with chemical-heterogeneity-induced local minima{,} which correspond to the equilibrium morphologies of the droplets. Phase-field (PF) simulations are accordingly conducted and compared with the predicted equilibrium morphologies. In addition{,} we propose a modified Cassie–Baxter (CB) model to delineate the equilibrium droplet shapes. In contrast to the classic CB model{,} our extension is not only restricted to the shape with a spherical cap. Both the energy landscape method and the modified CB model are demonstrated to have a good agreement with the PF simulations."}

abstract = {Domain decomposition approaches require efficient interface techniques when fluids and structures are solved in independent computational domains for aerospace applications. Fluid/structure interfacing techniques for solutions from equations based on low-fidelity approaches that are in the linear domain are well advanced and are incorporated in production codes NASTRAN and ASTROS. However, for computations involving high-fidelity equations such as the Navier–Stokes for fluids and finite elements for structures, interface approaches are still under development. This paper provides a technical overview of methods for interfacing flow solutions from the Euler/Navier–Stokes methods with structural solutions using modal/finite-element methods. Validity of the methods is supported by previously presented results.}

abstract = {The present work aims at examining nonlinear effects on film rupture by investigating the stability of thin films to finite amplitude disturbances. The dynamics of the liquid film is formulated using the Navier-Stokes equations augmented by a body force describing the London/van der Waals attractions. The liquid film is assumed to be charge neutralized, nondraining, and laterally unbounded. A nonlinear evolution equation is derived for h(x, t), the film thickness. This strongly nonlinear partial differential equation is solved by numerical methods as part of an initial-value problem for periodic boundary conditions in x, the lateral space dimension. Given this model, one obtains true rupture in the sense that the film thickness becomes zero in a finite time. The results reveal rupture characteristics and effects of nonlinearities on the rupture properties.}

  abstract={We study the stability of a finite-length fluid rivulet at rest on a partially wetting surface. We consider the problem by including the intermolecular force (van der Waals interaction) within the framework of the lubrication approximation. The results are validated by comparison with numerical simulations of the full nonlinear equation. For finite length rivulets, we show that the distance between drops after breakup is very close to the wavelength of maximum growth rate predicted by the linear theory for infinite rivulets. Finally, we compare theoretical and numerical results with reported experimental data.}

Starting with the classical potential flow theory for moving contact surfaces, the discussion extends to various fluid systems describing inhomogeneous, viscous, compressible, and isobaric flows. Thereby an overview on the major stability issues under a broad variety of physical conditions can be given. In particular, the stability analysis is addressed to layered materials in plane and spherical geometries under various dynamical conditions, to inhomogeneous media with variable gradients and different boundary conditions, to viscous boundary layers, compressible atmospheres, and to stationary ablation fronts in laser-driven plasma experiments. The stability theory is further extended to the nonlinear stage of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability and to a discussion of bubble dynamics in two and three dimensions for closed and open bubble domains. For this purpose simple flow models are studied that can describe essential features of bubble rise and bubble growth in buoyancy-driven mixing layers."

Despite the excellent barrier properties provided by these materials, all published data show some residual permeation, even when the barrier coatings are relatively thick (≥70 nm). This residual permeation is attributed to the presence of microscopic defects in the coatings. In this article we present new techniques, based mainly on reactive ion etching in oxygen plasma, to render visible micrometer- or sub-micrometer-sized defects in transparent ceramic films on polymers. These techniques can be used to visualize and better understand the origins of defects in these coatings on a microscopic scale, as well as for mapping and counting defect density on a macroscopic scale (tens of cm2 or more)."

To study such cases{,} we implement the boundary-element method to solve the governing Stokes equations for the fluid flow field inside and on the surface of a droplet and supplement it by the Cox–Voinov law for the dynamics of the contact line. Our approach reproduces the relaxation of an axisymmetric droplet in experiments{,} which we initiate by instantaneously switching the uniform wettability of a substrate quantified by the equilibrium contact angle. In a step profile of wettability the droplet moves towards higher wettability. Using a feedback loop to keep the distance or offset between step and droplet center constant{,} induces a constant velocity with which the droplet surfs on the wettability step. We analyze the velocity in terms of droplet offset and step width for typical wetting parameters. Moving instead the wettability step with constant speed{,} we determine the maximally possible droplet velocities under various conditions. The observed droplet speeds agree with the values from the feedback study for the same positive droplet offset."}

Standard photolithographic techniques are used to obtain this precise surface-feature patterning. Positive photoresists, S1813 and AZ4620, are selected to mask the surface, and a mixture of BCl3 and Cl2 gases is used to perform the etching. Experimental data show that a droplet placed on the micro-grooved aluminum surface using a micro-syringe exhibits an increased apparent contact angle, and for droplets condensed on these etched surfaces, more than a 50$\%$ reduction in the volume needed for the onset of droplet sliding is manifest. No chemical surface treatment is necessary to achieve this water repellency; it is accomplished solely by an anisotropic surface morphology that manipulates droplet geometry and creates and exploits discontinuities in the three-phase contact line. These micro-structured surfaces are proposed for use in a broad range of air-cooling applications, where the management of condensate and defrost liquid on the heat transfer surface is essential to the energy-efficient operation of the machine.}

However, there has been a trade-off between speed and resolution for fabricating structures with this method. Saha et al. optimize a new parallel printing methodology that relies on ultrafast lasers. They show the ability to dramatically increase the speed of printing while maintaining submicrometer resolution. Science, this issue p. 105 Femtosecond lasers can be used to print very thin 3D structures at ultrafast rates. High-throughput fabrication techniques for generating arbitrarily complex three-dimensional structures with nanoscale features are desirable across a broad range of applications. Two-photon lithography (TPL)–based submicrometer additive manufacturing is a promising candidate to fill this gap. However, the serial point-by-point writing scheme of TPL is too slow for many applications. Attempts at parallelization either do not have submicrometer resolution or cannot pattern complex structures. We overcome these difficulties by spatially and temporally focusing an ultrafast laser to implement a projection-based layer-by-layer parallelization. This increases the throughput up to three orders of magnitude and expands the geometric design space. We demonstrate this by printing, within single-digit millisecond time scales, nanowires with widths smaller than 175 nanometers over an area one million times larger than the cross-sectional area.}}

The models are obtained as asymptotic limits of the Navier-Stokes equations with the Navier-slip boundary condition for different orders of magnitude for the slip-length parameter. Specifically, the influence of slip on the dewetting behavior of fluids on hydrophobic substrates is investigated here. Matched asymptotics are used to describe the dynamic profiles for dewetting films and comparison is given with computational simulations. The motion of the dewetting front shows transitions from being nearly linear in time for no-slip to t2/3 as the slip is increased. For much larger slip lengths the front motion appears to become linear again. Correspondingly, the dewetting profiles undergo a transition from oscillatory to monotone decay into the uniform film layer for large slip. Increasing the slip further, to very large values, is associated with an increasing degree of asymmetry in the structure of the dewetting ridge profile},

abstract = "Experimental results are reported on the spreading of a nonvolatile liquid drop on a horizontal smooth solid surface with negligible effects of gravity and inertia. The liquid is strongly wetting to the solid with an advancing static contact angle θs less than 1°. The drop radius R, the apex height H, and the advancing dynamic contact angle θ were measured as functions of time t. For each drop the data of R-t, H-t, and θ-t follow different power laws, αtβ. The values of α and β for R are close to those predicted by Starov (J. Colloid USSR (Engl. Trans)45(6), 1009 (1983)) for a spreading drop under the action of capillary and viscous forces. But the data for H and θ show less satisfactory agreement with the predictions. For θ two different quantities are measured: θ0 is the angle between the tangent to the drop edge and the solid surface and θRH is the angle calculated from R and H for a spherical drop. The measured θ range from 1.5 to 17°, for capillary number C from 1.8 × 10−6 to 3.3 × 10−4. Correlation by a least-squares fit for the θ-C data gives θ0 = 222C0.353and θRH = 242C0.353 (both in degrees). Good agreement is found between our θ-C data and correlations with those presented in the literature for experiments in a capillary tube (R. L. Hoffman, J. Colloid Interface Sci.50, 228 (1975); T. S. Jiang et al., J. Colloid Interface Sci.69, 74 (1979) and in parallel plate (C. G. Ngan and E. B. Dussan V, J. Fluid Mech.118, 27 (1982)) for a wide range of θ and C. This suggests that, when the capillary and viscous forces are the only dominant factors, θ is independent of the experimental geometry. And hence the correlations can be used to estimate θ when a nonvolatile liquid displaces air with θs < 1° under a dynamically similar condition."

	journal = {Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics},
	abstract = {A study of the spreading of silicone oil drops is presented, with particular attention to the dominant effect of the conditions near the edge and the surface tension forces acting there. It is shown that the drop profiles can be predicted and that this leads to a relation between the edge velocity and the maximum slope, which occurs at an inflection point close to the edge. This relation leads to others governing the variation of drop size and slope with time. The predictions are compared with experiment, using silicone oils, and good agreement obtained. The lubrication approximation theory gives no solution for thicknesses below a value varying from 2 to 9*10-8 m at the drop edge. At thicknesses of this order, or possibly even larger, other effects become important, and some observations on edge behaviour are included.}

	journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
	abstract = {The basic mechanisms which take place during the displacement of immiscible fluids in porous media have been observed in micromodels and have been modelled. At the pore level, in drainage, the invading fluid chooses the largest throat. In imbibition, the displacement depends on the local geometry. For a large pore-to-throat ratio (aspect ratio), the main mechanism is the collapse of the invading fluid in the smallest channel, without entering the pore. For a small aspect ratio, the wetting fluid invades the pore first, and then the adjacent channels. From observations at the pore level, the author has modelled the displacement on a large scale in some extreme cases by using statistical theories. The different behaviours are then displayed as domains in three phase diagrams: one for drainage and two for imbibition (large and small aspect ratios). At a high rate, when viscous forces are dominant, all the diagrams show a stable domain (described by anti-DLA) and a viscous fingering domain (DLA). In drainage, low capillary numbers lead to capillary fingering represented by invasion percolation. In imbibition, the capillary domain is described either by a compact cluster growth (small aspect ratio) or percolation theory (large aspect ratio). In addition the possibility of flow by film along the roughness of the walls leads to disconnected structures.}

  abstract = {Summary Proper approximation of the force terms, especially the bed slope term, is of crucial importance to simulating shallow water flows in lattice Boltzmann (LB) models. However, there is little discussion on the schemes of adding force terms to LB models for shallow water equations (SWEs). In this study, we evaluate the performance of forcing schemes coupled with different LB models (LABSWE and MLBSWE) in simulating shallow water flows over complex topography and try to find out their intrinsic characteristics and applicability. Three cases are adopted for evaluation, including a stationary case, a one-dimensional tidal wave flow over an irregular bed, and a steady flow over a two-dimensional seamount. The simulating results are compared with analytical solutions or the results produced by the finite difference method. For LABSWE, all the forcing schemes, except for the weighting factor method, fail to produce accurate solutions for the test cases; this is probably due to the mismatch between the bed slope term in source terms and the quadratic depth term of the equilibrium distribution functions in these forcing schemes. For MLBSWE, all the forcing schemes are capable of simulating flows over the complex topography accurately; furthermore, those schemes taking into account the collision effect τ to eliminate the momentum induced by forces provide more accurate solutions with quicker convergence as the lattice size decreases. In this view, MLBSWE can bring more flexibility in treating the force terms and thus can be a better tool to simulate shallow water flows over complex topography in practical application.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY In this paper the dynamics of a two-layered liquid, made of two immiscible shallow-layers of different density, has been investigated within the framework of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The LBM developed in this paper for the two-layered, shallow-water flow has been obtained considering two separate sets of LBM equations, one for each layer. The coupling terms between the two sets have been defined as external forces, acted on one layer by the other. Results obtained from the LBM developed in this paper are compared with numerical results obtained solving the two-layered, shallow-water equations, with experimental and other numerical results published in literature. The results are interesting. First, the numerical results obtained by the LBM and by the shallow-water model can be considered as equivalent. Second, the LBM developed in this paper is able to simulate motion conditions on nonflat topography. Third, the agreement between the LBM (and also shallow-water model) numerical results and the experimental results is good when the evolution of the flow does not depend on the viscosity, that is, during the initial phase of the flow, dominated by gravity and inertia forces. When the viscous forces dominate the evolution of the flow the agreement between numerical and experimental results depends strongly on the viscosity; it is good if the numerical LBM viscosity has the same order of magnitude of the liquid's kinematic viscosity.

abstract="The giant tsunami that occurred in the Indian Ocean on 26th December 2004 draws attention to this natural phenomenon. The given course of lectures deals with the physics of the tsunami wave propagation from the source to the coast. Briefly, the geographical distribution of the tsunamis is described and physical mechanisms of their origin are discussed. Simplified robust formulas for the source parameters (dimension and height) are given for tsunamis of different origin. It is shown that the shallow-water theory is an adequate model to describe the tsunamis of the seismic origin; meanwhile for the tsunamis of the landslide or explosion origin (volcanoes, asteroid impact) various theories (from linear dispersive to nonlinear shallow-water equations) can be applied. The applicability of the existing theories to describe the tsunami wave propagation, refraction, transformation and climbing on the coast is demonstrated. Nonlinear-dispersive effects including the role of the solitons are discussed. The practical usage of the tsunami modeling for the tsunami forecasting and tsunami risk evaluation is described. The results of the numerical simulations of the two global tsunamis in the Indian Ocean induced by the catastrophic Krakatau eruption in 1883 and the strongest North Sumatra earthquake in 2004 are given.",

abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.}

abstract = {A parallel message-passing implementation of a molecular dynamics (MD) program that is useful for bio(macro)molecules in aqueous environment is described. The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.}

abstract = { It has already been asserted, by Mr. Monge and others, that the phenomena of capillary tubes are referable to the cohesive attraction of the superficial particles only of the fluids em­ployed, and that the surfaces must consequently be formed into curves of the nature of lintearias, which are supposed to be the results of a uniform tension of a surface, resisting the pressure of a fluid, either uniform, or varying according to a given law. Segner, who appears to have been the first that maintained a similar opinion, has shown in what manner the principle may be deduced from the doctrine of attraction, but his demonstration is complicated, and not perfectly satisfactory; and in applying the law to the forms of drops, he has neglected to consider the very material effects of the double curvature, which is evidently the cause of the want of a perfect coinci­dence of some of his experiments with his theory. Since the time of Segner, little has been done in investigating accurately and in detail the various consequences of the principle. It will perhaps be most agreeable to the experimental phi­losopher, although less consistent with the strict course of logical argument, to proceed in the first place to the comparison of this theory with the phenomena, and to inquire afterwards for its foundation in the ultimate properties of matter. But it is necessary to premise one observation, which appears to be new, and which is equally consistent with theory and with experiment; that is, that for each combination of a solid and a fluid, there is an appropriate angle of contact between the surfaces of the fluid, exposed to the air, and to the solid. This angle, for glass and water, and in all cases where a solid is perfectly wetted by a fluid, is evanescent: for glass and mer­cury, it is about 140°, in common temperatures, and when the mercury is moderately clean. }

  abstract = {Abstract The development of multiphase liquid-liquid morphologies during mixing at small Reynolds numbers has been modeled. The mixing process is divided into (i) stretching of dispersed drops. (ii) breakup of the liquid threads formed, and (iii) coalescence of the final droplets upon collision. Rules and criteria of the distinct processes are presented and combined to a general 2-zone mixing model simplifying the flow field into a sequence of alternating “strong and weak zones.” In a “strong zone,” dispersed drops and threads are stretched unless their radius is too small; meanwhile, the stretching threads might break up into droplets. In the subsequent “weak zone,” the remaining threads may disintegrate while any drops present may coalesce. After passing a number of zones, stretching, breakup, and coalescence lead to a dynamic equilibrium that could be considered as the “final” morphology. Using the 2-zone mixing model, the influence of material parameters and processing conditions on the morphology has been studied. Interestingly, increasing either viscosity (dispersed or continuous phase) yields a finer morphology due to the delay of thread breakup, allowing for further stretching and suppression of coalescence.},

  abstract = {Mayonnaise a mixture of egg, vinegar, oil and spices is probably one of the oldest and most widely used sauces in the world today. Traditional mayonnaise is an oil-in-water emulsion despite containing 70–80\% fat. Careful mixing of the ingredients and the addition of minor constituents help to maintain a closely packed foam of oil droplets. Low-fat mayonnaises need additional ingredients to maintain their stability. Mayonnaise, in common with all high fat foods, is susceptible to spoilage due to auto-oxidation, its stability depending on the type of oil used. Salt, as well as being important in the development of the flavour and stability appears to influence the rate of oxidation of the oil in the emulsion. The characteristic flavour of mayonnaise is derived principally from the addition of mustard, which contains isothiocyanates. These isothiocyanates are stabilized in the aqueous solution by the addition of citric acid. An understanding of the physical and chemical processes involved in the formation of emulsions has allowed the manufacture of mayonnaise, which is much, more stable during long-term storage and the development of products which contain a greater range of novel flavours.}

abstract = {The spontaneous spreading (called superspreading) of aqueous trisiloxane ethoxylate surfactant solutions on hydrophobic solid surfaces is a fascinating phenomenon with several practical applications. For example, the ability of trisiloxane ethoxylate surfactants to enhance the spreading of spray solutions on waxy weed leaf surfaces, such as velvetleaf (Abutilion theophrasti), makes them excellent wetting agents for herbicide applications. The superspreading ability of silicone surfactants has been known for decades, but its mechanism is still not well understood. In this paper, we suggest that the spreading of trisiloxane ethoxylates is controlled by a surface tension gradient, which forms when a drop of surfactant solution is placed on a solid surface. The proposed model suggests that, as the spreading front stretches, the surface tension increases (the surfactant concentration becomes lower) at the front relative to the top of the droplet, thereby establishing a dynamic surface tension gradient. The driving force for spreading is due to the Marangoni effect, and our experiments showed that the higher the gradient, the faster the spreading. A simple model describing the phenomenon of superspreading is presented. We also suggest that the superspreading behavior of trisiloxane ethoxylates is a consequence of the molecular configuration at the air/water surface (i.e. small and compact hydrophobic part), as shown by molecular dynamics modeling. We also found that the aggregates and vesicles formed in trisiloxane solutions do not initiate the spreading process and therefore these structures are not a requirement for the superspreading process.}
