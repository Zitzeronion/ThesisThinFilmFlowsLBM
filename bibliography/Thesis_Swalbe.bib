When either the viscosity is large or the surface tension is small enough, we observe that the opening of the liquid bridge initially proceeds at a constant speed set by the capillary velocity. In the first system we show that inertial effects become dominant at a Reynolds number of about 1.5{$\pm$}0.5 and the neck then grows as the square root of time. In the second system we show that decreasing the surface tension by a factor of 105 opens the way to a more complete understanding of the hydrodynamics involved.},

This paper examines explicit Eulerian discretizations of the full LLNS equations. Several computational fluid dynamics approaches are considered (including MacCormack's two-step Lax-Wendroff scheme and the piecewise parabolic method) and are found to give good results for the variance of momentum fluctuations. However, neither of these schemes accurately reproduces the fluctuations in energy or density. We introduce a conservative centered scheme with a third-order Runge-Kutta temporal integrator that does accurately produce fluctuations in density, energy, and momentum. A variety of numerical tests, including the random walk of a standing shock wave, are considered and results from the stochastic LLNS solver are compared with theory, when available, and with molecular simulations using a direct simulation Monte Carlo algorithm.},

We accomplish this by combining highly controlled experiments on different film-rupture patterns with computer simulations using novel numerical schemes for thin-film equations. For the quantitative comparison of the pattern evolution in both experiment and simulation we introduce a novel pattern analysis method based on Minkowski measures.

  abstract = {Clean code that works--now. This is the seeming contradiction that lies behind much of the pain of programming. Test-driven development replies to this contradiction with a paradox--test the program before you write it. A new idea? Not at all. Since the dawn of computing, programmers have been specifying the inputs and outputs before programming precisely. Test-driven development takes this age-old idea, mixes it with modern languages and programming environments, and cooks up a tasty stew guaranteed to satisfy your appetite for clean code that works--now. Developers face complex programming challenges every day, yet they are not always readily prepared to determine the best solution. More often than not, such difficult projects generate a great deal of stress and bad code. To garner the strength and courage needed to surmount seemingly Herculean tasks, programmers should look to test-driven development (TDD), a proven set of techniques that encourage simple designs and test suites that inspire confidence. By driving development with automated tests and then eliminating duplication, any developer can write reliable, bug-free code no matter what its level of complexity. Moreover, TDD encourages programmers to learn quickly, communicate more clearly, and seek out constructive feedback. Readers will learn to:  Solve complicated tasks, beginning with the simple and proceeding to the more complex. Write automated tests before coding. Grow a design organically by refactoring to add design decisions one at a time. Create tests for more complicated logic, including reflection and exceptions. Use patterns to decide what tests to write. Create tests using xUnit, the architecture at the heart of many programmer-oriented testing tools.  This book follows two TDD projects from start to finish, illustrating techniques programmers can use to easily and dramatically increase the quality of their work. The examples are followed by references to the featured TDD patterns and refactorings. With its emphasis on agile methods and fast development strategies, Test-Driven Development is sure to inspire readers to embrace these under-utilized but powerful techniques.   0321146530B10172002},

The identification of effective control strategies to, e.g. suppress or enhance the convective heat exchange under fixed external thermal gradients is an outstanding fundamental and technological issue. In this work, we explore a novel approach, based on a state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, which is capable of significantly reducing the heat transport in a two-dimensional Rayleigh\textendash B\'enard system by applying small temperature fluctuations to the lower boundary of the system. By using numerical simulations, we show that our RL-based control is able to stabilise the conductive regime and bring the onset of convection up to a Rayleigh number Rac{$\approx$}3{$\cdot$}104, whereas state-of-the-art linear controllers have Rac{$\approx$}104. Additionally, for Ra{$>$}3{$\cdot$}104, our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art control algorithms reducing the heat flux by a factor of about 2.5. In the last part of the manuscript, we address theoretical limits connected to controlling an unstable and chaotic dynamics as the one considered here. We show that controllability is hindered by observability and/or capabilities of actuating actions, which can be quantified in terms of characteristic time delays. When these delays become comparable with the Lyapunov time of the system, control becomes impossible.},

We calculate the disjoining pressure isotherm and show that it is completely dominated by the long-range van der Waals interactions. Thick films exhibit the expected Hamaker power law decay, but a quantitative description of thin films requires consideration of the detailed structure of the adsorbed layer. The spectrum of film height fluctuations is calculated and shown to provide reliable estimates of the disjoining pressure for all films studied. However, it is observed that the full spectrum can only be reproduced provided that we account for a film height dependent surface tension proportional to the derivative of the disjoining pressure. A simple theory is worked out that describes well the observed film height dependence. Having at hand both the surface tension and the disjoining pressure, we calculate the healing distance of the liquid films, which differs from the classical expectation by a constant of the same order of magnitude as the bulk correlation length. We show these findings have important implications on the behavior of adsorbed liquids and determine corrections to the augmented Young\textendash Laplace equation at the subnanometer length scale.},

The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.},

Although the impact and subsequent retraction of non-wetting aqueous drops on a hydrophobic surface have been the subjects of extensive experimental and theoretical work2,3,4,5,6,7, non-newtonian rheological effects have not been considered in any detail. Here we report that, by adding very small amounts of a flexible polymer to the aqueous phase, we can inhibit droplet rebound on a hydrophobic surface and markedly improve deposition without significantly altering the shear viscosity of the solutions. Our results can be understood by taking into account the non-newtonian elongational viscosity, which provides a large resistance to drop retraction after impact, thereby suppressing droplet rebound.},

Writing efficient device code is challenging, and is typically done in a low-level programming language. High-level languages are rarely supported, or do not integrate with the rest of the high-level language ecosystem. To overcome this, we propose compiler infrastructure to efficiently add support for new hardware or environments to an existing programming language. We evaluate our approach by adding support for NVIDIA GPUs to the Julia programming language. By integrating with the existing compiler, we significantly lower the cost to implement and maintain the new compiler, and facilitate reuse of existing application code. Moreover, use of the high-level Julia programming language enables new and dynamic approaches for GPU programming. This greatly improves programmer productivity, while maintaining application performance similar to that of the official NVIDIA CUDA toolkit.},

  abstract = {The software needs of scientists and engineers are growing and their programs are becoming more compute-heavy and problem-specific. This has led to an influx of non-expert programmers, who need to use and program high-performance computing platforms. With the continued stagnation of single-threaded performance, using hardware accelerators such as GPUs or FPGAs is necessary. Adapting software to these compute platforms is a difficult task, especially for non-expert programmers, leading to applications being unable to take advantage of new hardware or requiring extensive rewrites. We propose a programming model that allows non-experts to benefit from high-performance computing, while enabling expert programmers to take full advantage of the underlying hardware. In this model, programs are generically typed, the location of the data is encoded in the type system, and multiple dispatch is used to select functionality based on the type of the data. This enables rapid prototyping, retargeting and reuse of existing software, while allowing for hardware specific optimization if required. Our approach allows development to happen in one source language enabling domain experts and performance engineers to jointly develop a program, without the overhead, friction, and challenges associated with developing in multiple programming languages for the same project. We demonstrate the viability and the core principles of this programming model in Julia using realistic examples, showing the potential of this approach for rapid prototyping, and its applicability for real-life engineering. We focus on usability for non-expert programmers and demonstrate that the potential of the underlying hardware can be fully exploited.},

The variation in droplet volume, contact angle, ambient temperature, and humidity are considered. We analyze the chances of the survival of the virus present in the droplet based on the lifetime of the droplets under several conditions and find that the chances of the survival of the virus are strongly affected by each of these parameters. The magnitude of shear stress inside the droplet computed using the model is not large enough to obliterate the virus.

  abstract = {A kinetic theory approach to collision processes in ionized and neutral gases is presented. This approach is adequate for the unified treatment of the dynamic properties of gases over a continuous range of pressures from the Knudsen limit to the high-pressure limit where the aerodynamic equations are valid. It is also possible to satisfy the correct microscopic boundary conditions. The method consists in altering the collision terms in the Boltzmann equation. The modified collision terms are constructed so that each collision conserves particle number, momentum, and energy; other characteristics such as persistence of velocities and angular dependence may be included. The present article illustrates the technique for a simple model involving the assumption of a collision time independent of velocity; this model is applied to the study of small amplitude oscillations of one-component ionized and neutral gases. The initial value problem for unbounded space is solved by performing a Fourier transformation on the space variables and a Laplace transformation on the time variable. For uncharged gases there results the correct adiabatic limiting law for sound-wave propagation at high pressures and, in addition, one obtains a theory of absorption and dispersion of sound for arbitrary pressures. For ionized gases the difference in the nature of the organization in the low-pressure plasma oscillations and in high-pressure sound-type oscillations is studied. Two important cases are distinguished. If the wavelengths of the oscillations are long compared to either the Debye length or the mean free path, a small change in frequency is obtained as the collision frequency varies from zero to infinity. The accompanying absorption is small; it reaches its maximum value when the collision frequency equals the plasma frequency. The second case refers to waves shorter than both the Debye length and the mean free path; these waves are characterized by a very heavy absorption.},

On the other hand, an instability of the liquid film against the growth in amplitude of surface waves with a characteristic wavelength is observed, which we believe is the first observation of spinodal dewetting. In contrast, the final structure of the ruptured film depends on whether nucleation or spinodal dewetting is dominant.},

  abstract = {Wetting phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and technology. A solid substrate exposed to the environment is almost invariably covered by a layer of fluid material. In this review, the surface forces that lead to wetting are considered, and the equilibrium surface coverage of a substrate in contact with a drop of liquid. Depending on the nature of the surface forces involved, different scenarios for wetting phase transitions are possible; recent progress allows us to relate the critical exponents directly to the nature of the surface forces which lead to the different wetting scenarios. Thermal fluctuation effects, which can be greatly enhanced for wetting of geometrically or chemically structured substrates, and are much stronger in colloidal suspensions, modify the adsorption singularities. Macroscopic descriptions and microscopic theories have been developed to understand and predict wetting behavior relevant to microfluidics and nanofluidics applications. Then the dynamics of wetting is examined. A drop, placed on a substrate which it wets, spreads out to form a film. Conversely, a nonwetted substrate previously covered by a film dewets upon an appropriate change of system parameters. The hydrodynamics of both wetting and dewetting is influenced by the presence of the three-phase contact line separating ``wet'' regions from those that are either dry or covered by a microscopic film only. Recent theoretical, experimental, and numerical progress in the description of moving contact line dynamics are reviewed, and its relation to the thermodynamics of wetting is explored. In addition, recent progress on rough surfaces is surveyed. The anchoring of contact lines and contact angle hysteresis are explored resulting from surface inhomogeneities. Further, new ways to mold wetting characteristics according to technological constraints are discussed, for example, the use of patterned surfaces, surfactants, or complex fluids.},

In addition to the classical layer depth and velocity in shallow models, our system describes also the evolution of two components of the stress. It has an intrinsic energy equation. The mathematical properties of the model are established, an important feature being the non-convexity of the physically relevant energy with respect to conservative variables, but the convexity with respect to the physically relevant pseudo-conservative variables. Numerical illustrations are given, based on a suitable well-balanced finite-volume discretization involving an approximate Riemann solver.},

When these two configurations are very close to each other, classical solutions do exist, as shown by Ebin and Marsden. However, Shnirelman found a class of data (essentially 2D in the sense that they trivially depend on the vertical coordinate) for which there cannot be any classical minimizer. For such data, generalized solutions can be shown to exist, as a substitute for classical solutions. These generalized solutions have unusual features that look highly unphysical (in particular, different fluid parcels can cross at the same point and at the same time), but the pressure field, which does not depend on the vertical coordinate, is well and uniquely defined. In the present paper, we show that these generalized solutions are actually quite conventional in the sense they obey, up to a suitable change of variable, a well-known variant (widely used for geophysical flows) of the 3D Euler equations, for which the vertical acceleration is neglected according to the so-called hydrostatic approximation.},

We propose the first order kinetic model to describe dynamic contact angles of such adaptive surfaces. The model is general and does not refer to a particular adaptation process. The aim of the proposed model is to provide a quantitative description of adaptive wetting and to link changes in contact angles to microscopic adaptation processes. By introducing exponentially relaxing interfacial energies and applying Young's equation locally, we predict a change of advancing and receding contact angles depending on the velocity of the contact line. Even for perfectly homogeneous and smooth surfaces, a dynamic contact angle hysteresis is obtained. As possible adaptations, we discuss changes and reconstruction of polymer surfaces or monolayers, diffusion and swelling, adsorption of surfactants, replacement of contaminants, reorientation of liquid molecules, or formation of an electric double layer.},

  abstract = {The ability to trap or deflect sliding drops is of great interest in microfluidics, as it has several technological applications, ranging from self-cleaning and fog harvesting surfaces to laboratory-on-a-chip devices. We present a three-dimensional numerical model that describes sliding droplets interacting with wetting defects of variable strength and size. This approach provides relevant insight if compared to simplified analytic models, as it allows us to assess the relevance of the internal degrees of freedom of the droplet. We observe that the deformation of the drop enhances the effective strength and range of the defect, and we quantify this effect by comparison to a point-mass model. We also analyze the role of the steepness and strength of the defect on the drop motion, observing that small, strong defects are more effective at trapping than large, shallow traps of same excess surface energy. Finally, our results show quantitative agreement with previously reported electrowetting experiments, suggesting a universal behavior in droplet trapping that does not depend strongly on the nature of the defect.},

  abstract = {Great advances have been made with the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method for complicated fluid phenomena and fundamental thermal processes over the past three decades. This paper presents a systematic overview of the LB method from 1990 to 2018, based on bibliometric analysis and the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E) database. The results show that China took the leading position in this field, followed by the USA and UK. The Chinese Academy of Sciences had the most publications, while the Los Alamos National Laboratory was first as far as highest average citation per paper and h-index are concerned. Physical Review E was the most productive journal and ``Mechanics'' was the most frequently used subject category. Keyword analysis indicated that recent research has focused on the natural convection and heat transfer of nanofluid or multiphase flow in complex porous media. Hydrothermal treatment of nanofluid with shape factor on the conditions, such as variable magnetic fields, thermal radiation and slipping boundary, were the research hotspots. Further research perspectives mainly explore the multiscale models for coupling multiple transport phenomena, morphology optimization of porous parameters, new nanoparticles with shape factor, multicomponent LB method considering Knudsen diffusion effect, LB-based hybrid methods, radiation performance or boiling-heat transfer of nanofluid, and the active control of droplets, may continue to attract more attention. Moreover, some new applications, such as phase change of metal foam, erosion induced by nanaofluid, anode circulating, 3D modeling in thermal systems with vibration, and magnetohydrodynamics microfluid devices, could be of interest going forward.},

A better understanding of rupture is important for controlling and modeling the stability of multiphase products. Yet literature reports that film breakup can be either stochastic or deterministic. Here, we employ a modified thin film balance to vary the ratio of hydrodynamic to capillary stresses and its role on the dynamics of thin liquid films of polymer solutions with adequate viscosities. Varying the pressure drop across planar films allows us to control the ratio of the two competing timescales, i.e., a controlled hydrodynamic drainage time and a timescale related to fluctuations. The thickness fluctuations are visualized and quantified, and their characteristics are for the first time directly measured experimentally for varying strengths of the flow inside the film. We show how the criteria for rupture depend on the hydrodynamic conditions, changing from stochastic to deterministic as the hydrodynamic forces inside the film damp the fluctuations.},

  abstract = {Experimental results are reported on the spreading of a nonvolatile liquid drop on a horizontal smooth solid surface with negligible effects of gravity and inertia. The liquid is strongly wetting to the solid with an advancing static contact angle \texttheta s less than 1\textdegree. The drop radius R, the apex height H, and the advancing dynamic contact angle \texttheta{} were measured as functions of time t. For each drop the data of R-t, H-t, and \texttheta -t follow different power laws, {$\alpha$}t{$\beta$}. The values of {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} for R are close to those predicted by Starov (J. Colloid USSR (Engl. Trans)45(6), 1009 (1983)) for a spreading drop under the action of capillary and viscous forces. But the data for H and \texttheta{} show less satisfactory agreement with the predictions. For \texttheta{} two different quantities are measured: \texttheta 0 is the angle between the tangent to the drop edge and the solid surface and \texttheta RH is the angle calculated from R and H for a spherical drop. The measured \texttheta{} range from 1.5 to 17\textdegree, for capillary number C from 1.8 \texttimes{} 10-6 to 3.3 \texttimes{} 10-4. Correlation by a least-squares fit for the \texttheta -C data gives \texttheta 0 = 222C0.353and \texttheta RH = 242C0.353 (both in degrees). Good agreement is found between our \texttheta -C data and correlations with those presented in the literature for experiments in a capillary tube (R. L. Hoffman, J. Colloid Interface Sci.50, 228 (1975); T. S. Jiang et al., J. Colloid Interface Sci.69, 74 (1979) and in parallel plate (C. G. Ngan and E. B. Dussan V, J. Fluid Mech.118, 27 (1982)) for a wide range of \texttheta{} and C. This suggests that, when the capillary and viscous forces are the only dominant factors, \texttheta{} is independent of the experimental geometry. And hence the correlations can be used to estimate \texttheta{} when a nonvolatile liquid displaces air with \texttheta s {$<$} 1\textdegree{} under a dynamically similar condition.},

In this paper, we introduce the basic principles of the lattice gas method and the lattice Boltzmann method, their numerical implementations and applications to chemically reacting systems.

Applied to the shallow water equations, with its different equation of state, the same approach yields discrete equilibria that are subject to a grid scale computational instability. Different and stable equilibria were previously constructed by Salmon [J. Marine Res. 57, 503 (1999)]. The two sets of equilibria differ through a nonhydrodynamic or ``ghost'' mode that has no direct effect on the hydrodynamic behavior derived in the slowly varying limit. However, Salmon's equilibria eliminate a coupling between hydrodynamic and ghost modes, one that leads to instability with a growth rate increasing with wave number. Previous work has usually assumed that truncated moment expansions lead to stable schemes. Such instabilities have implications for lattice Boltzmann equations that simulate other nonideal equations of state, or that simulate fully compressible, nonisothermal fluids using additional particles.},

  abstract = {Film thickness determines many key coating properties including gloss. However, current literature hardly addresses the development of methods to directly correlate film thickness with gloss. Thus, the lack of accurate models hinders further product design and optimisation of coating products and processes. In this contribution, a previously derived gloss-viscosity relationship is turned into a gloss-film thickness mathematical model. Experimental results of both matting and glossy agents are found to be successfully predicted by a model that is revealed as a simple and useful tool for day-to-day calculations. Polybenzoxazine coatings were elaborated by dip coating of a solution, prepared from a commercial bisphenol A benzoxazine (BA-a), on a 1050 aluminum alloy. The monomer was dissolved in acetone and the influence of the different application parameters (withdrawal speed and viscosity of the solution) on the wet coating thickness was evaluated. A heat treatment was then performed on the coating to polymerize the benzoxazine monomer by a ring opening mechanism attested for by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and followed by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Dielectric Analysis (DEA) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) showed a particular behavior related to a partial decomposition taking place at 180 \textdegree C and associated with the creation of intermediary ionic and volatile species. Finally, the barrier protection was evaluated by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) for 30 days in sodium chloride solution (0.1 M). The results showed an improvement of the impedance modulus from 104 {$\Omega$} cm2 for an uncoated aluminum to a value as high as 109 {$\Omega$} cm2 with a 10-{$\mu$}m thick polybenzoxazine coating.},

We discuss in detail the scaling of the emerging wavelengths (distance between drops formed after the breakup process) with the rivulet cross-sectional area. Perhaps surprisingly, we uncover close connection between this scaling and the one for the breakup of a free-space fluid jet (Rayleigh\textendash Plateau instability).

These fluctuations are represented by a stochastic noise term added to the deterministic equation for the film thickness within the long-wave approximation. Unlike the case of polymeric films, we find that this noise, while remaining white in time, must be colored in space, at least in some regimes. The corresponding noise term is characterized by a nonzero correlation length, {$\mathscr{l}$}c, which, combined with the size of the system, leads to a dimensionless parameter {$\beta$} that accounts for the relative importance of the spatial correlation ({$\beta\sim\mathscr{l}-$}1c). We perform the linear stability analysis (LSA) of the film both with and without the noise term and find that for {$\mathscr{l}$}c larger than some critical value (depending on the system size), the wavelength of the peak of the spectrum is larger than that corresponding to the deterministic case, while for smaller {$\mathscr{l}$}c this peak corresponds to smaller wavelength than the latter. Interestingly, whatever the value of {$\mathscr{l}$}c, the peak always approaches the deterministic one for larger times. We compare LSA results with the numerical simulations of the complete nonlinear problem and find a good agreement in the power spectra for early times at different values of {$\beta$}. For late times, we find that the stochastic LSA predicts well the position of the dominant wavelength, showing that nonlinear interactions do not modify the trends of the early linear stages. Finally, we fit the theoretical spectra to experimental data from a nanometric laser-melted copper film and find that at later times, the adjustment requires smaller values of {$\beta$} (larger space correlations).},

  abstract = {Thin liquid films are ubiquitous in natural phenomena and technological applications. They have been extensively studied via deterministic hydrodynamic equations, but thermal fluctuations often play a crucial role that needs to be understood. An example of this is dewetting, which involves the rupture of a thin liquid film and the formation of droplets. Such a process is thermally activated and requires fluctuations to be taken into account self-consistently. In this work we present an analytical and numerical study of a stochastic thin-film equation derived from first principles. Following a brief review of the derivation, we scrutinise the behaviour of the equation in the limit of perfectly correlated noise along the wall-normal direction, as opposed to the perfectly uncorrelated limit studied by Gr\"un et al. (J. Stat. Phys. 122(6):1261\textendash 1291, 2006). We also present a numerical scheme based on a spectral collocation method, which is then utilised to simulate the stochastic thin-film equation. This scheme seems to be very convenient for numerical studies of the stochastic thin-film equation, since it makes it easier to select the frequency modes of the noise (following the spirit of the long-wave approximation). With our numerical scheme we explore the fluctuating dynamics of the thin film and the behaviour of its free energy in the vicinity of rupture. Finally, we study the effect of the noise intensity on the rupture time, using a large number of sample paths as compared to previous studies.},

  abstract = {Wetting and dewetting are both fundamental modes of motion of liquids on solid surfaces. They are critically important for processes in biology, chemistry, and engineering, such as drying, coating, and lubrication. However, recent progress in wetting, which has led to new fields such as superhydrophobicity and liquid marbles, has not been matched by dewetting. A significant problem has been the inability to study the model system of a uniform film dewetting from a nonwetting surface to a single macroscopic droplet\textemdash a barrier that does not exist for the reverse wetting process of a droplet spreading into a film. We report the dewetting of a dielectrophoresis-induced film into a single equilibrium droplet. The emergent picture of the full dewetting dynamics is of an initial regime, where a liquid rim recedes at constant speed and constant dynamic contact angle, followed by a relatively short exponential relaxation of a spherical cap shape. This sharply contrasts with the reverse wetting process, where a spreading droplet follows a smooth sequence of spherical cap shapes. Complementary numerical simulations and a hydrodynamic model reveal a local dewetting mechanism driven by the equilibrium contact angle, where contact line slip dominates the dewetting dynamics. Our conclusions can be used to understand a wide variety of processes involving liquid dewetting, such as drop rebound, condensation, and evaporation. In overcoming the barrier to studying single film-to-droplet dewetting, our results provide new approaches to fluid manipulation and uses of dewetting, such as inducing films of prescribed initial shapes and slip-controlled liquid retraction.},

  abstract = {When two drops of radius R touch, surface tension drives an initially singular motion  which joins them into a bigger drop with smaller surface area. This motion is always  viscously dominated at early times. We focus on the early-time behaviour of the radius  rm of the small bridge between the two drops. The flow is driven by a highly curved  meniscus of length 2{$\pi$}rm and width  {$\Delta$}[Lt      ]rm around the bridge, from which we conclude  that the leading-order problem is asymptotically equivalent to its two-dimensional  counterpart. For the case of inviscid surroundings, an exact two-dimensional solution  (Hopper 1990) shows that {$\Delta\propto$}r3m  and rm{$\sim$}(t{$\gamma$}/{$\pi\eta$}) ln  [t{$\gamma$}({$\eta$}R)]; and thus the same  is true in three dimensions. We also study the case of coalescence with an external  viscous fluid analytically and, for the case of equal viscosities, in detail numerically.  A significantly different structure is found in which the outer-fluid forms a toroidal  bubble of radius {$\Delta\propto$}r3/2m  at the meniscus and rm{$\sim$}(t{$\gamma$}/4{$\pi\eta$}) ln  [t{$\gamma$}/({$\eta$}R)]. This basic  difference is due to the presence of the outer-fluid viscosity, however small. With  lengths scaled by R a full description of the asymptotic flow for  rm(t)[Lt      ]1 involves matching of lengthscales of order  r2m, r3/2m,  rm, 1 and probably  r7/4m.},

  abstract = {Surface-tension-driven flows and, in particular, their tendency to decay spontaneously into drops have long fascinated naturalists, the earliest systematic experiments dating back to the beginning of the 19th century. Linear stability theory governs the onset of breakup and was developed by Rayleigh, Plateau, and Maxwell. However, only recently has attention turned to the nonlinear behavior in the vicinity of the singular point where a drop separates. The increased attention is due to a number of recent and increasingly refined experiments, as well as to a host of technological applications, ranging from printing to mixing and fiber spinning. The description of drop separation becomes possible because jet motion turns out to be effectively governed by one-dimensional equations, which still contain most of the richness of the original dynamics. In addition, an attraction for physicists lies in the fact that the separation singularity is governed by universal scaling laws, which constitute an asymptotic solution of the Navier-Stokes equation before and after breakup. The Navier-Stokes equation is thus continued uniquely through the singularity. At high viscosities, a series of noise-driven instabilities has been observed, which are a nested superposition of singularities of the same universal form. At low viscosities, there is rich scaling behavior in addition to aesthetically pleasing breakup patterns driven by capillary waves. The author reviews the theoretical development of this field alongside recent experimental work, and outlines unsolved problems.},

In particular, we focus on qualitative changes in the morphology and behavior of stationary sliding drops. We employ the inclination angle of the substrate as control parameter and use continuation techniques to analyze for several fixed droplet sizes the bifurcation diagram of stationary droplets, their linear stability, and relevant eigenmodes. The obtained predictions on existence ranges and instabilities are tested via direct numerical simulations that are also used to investigate a branch of time-periodic behavior (corresponding to repeated breakup-coalescence cycles, where the breakup is also denoted as pearling) which emerges at a global instability, the related hysteresis in behavior, and a period-doubling cascade. The nontrivial oscillatory behavior close to a Hopf bifurcation of drops with a finite-length tail is also studied. Finally, it is shown that the main features of the bifurcation diagram follow scaling laws over several decades of the droplet size.},

  abstract = {Here, the phenomenon of food sticking when frying in a frying pan is experimentally explained. Thermocapillary convection causes a dry spot formation in the center of the frying pan upon heating of the sunflower oil film. It is shown that the speed of formation of a dry spot is similar to the speed of receding motion of the edge of a droplet upon impact and spreading on a solid surface. This allows theoretical determination of the speed of dewetting. For the thin liquid film flowing vertically over a solid surface, the critical volumetric flow rate qcr partitions two regimes: metastable or subcritical, when small perturbation of the film free surface results in the film rupture (q {$<$} qcr) and stable or supercritical at q {$>$} qcr. For the falling thin liquid film, the critical volumetric flow rate qcr partitions two regimes: metastable or subcritical (q {$<$} qcr) and stable or supercritical at q {$>$} qcr. At q {$<$} qcr, small deformations of the film free surface result in the film rupture. For the case of the temperature distribution in the form of a unit step function, the fundamental solution G1(x) describing the deformation of the film free surface has been derived by the perturbation technique. This solution is important by itself since it describes the most ``dangerous'' film surface profile at a prescribed value of the temperature drop. For an arbitrary surface temperature distribution \texttheta{} ({$\xi$}), the convolution of G1({$\xi$}) and \texttheta{} {${'}$}({$\xi$}) yields the film thickness profile.},

Specifically, we use a lubrication model derived from the Stokes model for strong slippage and linearize the film profile around the flat, unperturbed film. For small slip lengths, we expand the linearized full Stokes model for small slopes up to third order. Using the respective model, we obtain, in addition to the slip length, the capillary number, from which we can estimate the viscosity of the fluid film. We compare numerical and experimental results, test the consistency and the validity of the models/approximations, and give an easy-to-follow guide of how they can be used to analyze experiments.},

The effect of these properties on the retention of pesticide sprays has been examined by a study of the sliding of drops of water and solutions of surfactants on wax and cellulose acetate surfaces. A theory, supported by experimental results, has been evolved to explain the movement of drops in terms of the size of the drop, the angle of tilt of the surface, the air/liquid surface tension, and the advancing and receding contact angles. This theory has been developed to predict the volume of spray liquid that will be retained on a solid surface. The retentions found in practice agree well with the theoretical figures for most of the spray/solid combinations examined under comparable conditions of spray droplet impaction. A slight modification of the theory permits the correction of some anomalous results obtained with easily wetted surfaces. A retention factor F for any spray liquid/solid combination may be calculated to predict the degree of retention of the liquid on the solid. This factor may be simplified, without undue loss of accuracy, to the form: F = \texttheta M[{$\gamma$}AL(cos \texttheta R - cos \texttheta A)/{$\rho$}]12, where \textbullet\texttheta A is the advancing contact angle;\textbullet\texttheta R is the receding contact angle;\textbullet\texttheta M is the arithmetic mean of \texttheta A and \texttheta R;\textbullet{$\gamma$}al is the air/liquid surface tension; and\textbullet{$\rho$} is the density of the spray liquid.

By analyzing the Fourier transforms of the SEM (scanning electron microscope) images obtained at different stages of the metal film evolution, we determine the emerging length scales at relevant stages of the instability development. The results are then discussed within the framework of a long-wave model. We find that the results may differ whether early or final stages of the instability are considered. On the basis of the interpretation of the experimental results, we discuss the influence of the parameters describing the interaction of the liquid metal with the solid substrate. By considering both the dependence of dominant length scales on the film thickness and the measured contact angle, we isolate a model which predicts well the trends found in the experimental data.},

Our approach reproduces the relaxation of an axisymmetric droplet in experiments, which we initiate by instantaneously switching the uniform wettability of a substrate quantified by the equilibrium contact angle. In a step profile of wettability the droplet moves towards higher wettability. Using a feedback loop to keep the distance or offset between step and droplet center constant, induces a constant velocity with which the droplet surfs on the wettability step. We analyze the velocity in terms of droplet offset and step width for typical wetting parameters. Moving instead the wettability step with constant speed, we determine the maximally possible droplet velocities under various conditions. The observed droplet speeds agree with the values from the feedback study for the same positive droplet offset.},

This presentation has the additional advantage of saving the reader the labor of confronting the wide range of terminology now in use. Tribology, the theory and practice of lubrication, is a broad subject, the exhaustive treatment of which would include thorough consideration both of the variety of mechanisms of lubrication and of bearing types. The treatment here is limited to those continuum fluid films, called simply ''films,'' which are associated with slider, journal, and sector thrust bearings. Considerable attention is given to incompressible films because films are often effectively incompressible. Thin film and boundary lubrication, the other important mechanisms of lubrication, are not examined here. There is a special focus upon gas lubrication.},

  abstract = {We present the results of a combined theoretical and numerical investigation of the rim-driven retraction of flat fluid sheets in both planar and circular geometries. Particular attention is given to the influence of the fluid viscosity on the evolution of the sheet and its bounding rim. In both geometries, after a transient that depends on the sheet viscosity and geometry, the film edge eventually attains the Taylor\textendash Culick speed predicted on the basis of inviscid theory. The emergence of this result in the viscous limit is rationalized by consideration of both momentum and energy arguments. We first consider the planar geometry considered by Brenner \& Gueyffier (Phys. Fluids, vol. 11, 1999, p. 737) and deduce new analytical expressions for the speed of the film edge at the onset of rupture and the evolution of the maximum film thickness for viscous films. In order to consider the expansion of a circular hole, we develop an appropriate lubrication model that predicts the form of the early stage dynamics of film rupture. Simulations of a broad range of flow parameters confirm the importance of geometry on the dynamics, verifying the exponential hole growth reported in early experimental studies. We demonstrate the sensitivity of the initial retraction speed on the film profile, and so suggest that the anomalous rate of retraction reported in these experiments may be attributed in part to geometric details of the puncture process.},

It is shown that these so-called ``liquid lenses'' merge by the self-similar vertical growth of a bridge connecting the two lenses. Using a slender analysis, we derive similarity solutions corresponding to the viscous and inertial limits. Excellent agreement is found with the experiments without any adjustable parameters, capturing both the spatial and temporal structures of the flow during coalescence. Finally, we consider the crossover between the two regimes and show that all data of different lens viscosities collapse on a single curve capturing the full range of the coalescence dynamics.},

Next, we extend the theoretical framework to incorporate the presence of air\textendash liquid interfaces and study the propagation of an air finger into a fluid-filled, non-axisymmetrically collapsed vessel\textemdash the fluid\textendash structure interaction equivalent of the ``Bretherton problem'', a model of pulmonary airway (re-)opening. Finally, we examine the effect of wall elasticity on the Rayleigh\textendash Plateau instability and show that fluid\textendash structure interaction facilitates the formation of occluding liquid bridges in liquid-lined elastic vessels\textemdash a scenario of relevance to the physiological problem of pulmonary airway closure. Throughout this chapter, we focus on the study of idealised model problems whose relative simplicity allows us to identify the primary physical mechanisms that underlie the observed behaviour.},

It has particular implications in understanding key microbial processes involved in remediation of environmental disasters, such as Deepwater Horizon oil spill. This work presents a development of scalable micro-transfer molding to functionalize a substrate with oily drop array to generate a microcosm mimicking bacteria encountering a rising droplet cloud. The volume of each drop within a large ``printed'' surface can be tuned by varying base geometry and area with characteristic scales from 5 to 50\,{$\mu$}m. Contrary to macroscopic counterparts, drops with non-Laplacian shapes, i.e. sharp corners, that appears to violate Young-Laplacian relationship locally, are produced. Although the drop relaxes into a spherical cap with constant mean curvature, the contact line with sharp corners remains pinned. Relaxation times from initial to asymptotic shape require extraordinarily long time ({$>$}7 days). We demonstrate that non-Laplacian drops are the direct results of self-pinning of contact line by nanoparticles in the oil. This technique has been applied to study biofilm formation at the oil-water interface and can be readily extended to other colloidal fluids.},

An improved velocity profile is proposed, based on the superposition of an inviscid fluid and a viscous layer inspired by the Interactive Boundary Layer interaction used in aeronautics. This leads to a new friction law which depends not only on velocity and depth but also on the variations of velocity and thickness of the viscous layer. The resulting system is an extended shallow water model consisting of three depth-integrated equations: the first two are mass and momentum conservation in which a slight correction on hydrostatic pressure has been made; the third one, known as von K\'arm\'an equation, describes the evolution of the viscous layer. This coupled model is shown to be conditionally hyperbolic, and a Godunov-type finite volume scheme is also proposed. Several numerical examples are provided and compared to the Multi-Layer Saint-Venant model. They emphasize the ability of the model to deal with unsteady viscous effects. They illustrate also the phase-lag between friction and topography, and even recover possible reverse flows.},

(ii) breakup of the liquid threads formed, and (iii) coalescence of the final droplets upon collision. Rules and criteria of the distinct processes are presented and combined to a general 2-zone mixing model simplifying the flow field into a sequence of alternating ``strong and weak zones.'' In a ``strong zone,'' dispersed drops and threads are stretched unless their radius is too small; meanwhile, the stretching threads might break up into droplets. In the subsequent ``weak zone,'' the remaining threads may disintegrate while any drops present may coalesce. After passing a number of zones, stretching, breakup, and coalescence lead to a dynamic equilibrium that could be considered as the ``final'' morphology. Using the 2-zone mixing model, the influence of material parameters and processing conditions on the morphology has been studied. Interestingly, increasing either viscosity (dispersed or continuous phase) yields a finer morphology due to the delay of thread breakup, allowing for further stretching and suppression of coalescence.},

However, there are not many systematic researches on the mechanism of jet formation, nor is there any reliable platform that enables us to evaluate jet performance. In this study, an approach to practically evaluate the jet stability of the dropon-demand (DOD) inkjet printing has been proposed, based on which the transient behavior of the DOD drop formation has been studied experimentally for Newtonian liquids with a range of different viscosities (1.0\textendash 11 cp) but of a comparable surface tension. For more viscous liquids, the rate of the jet retraction after a pinch-off from the nozzle was found to increase as the thread motion became more sharp and conical as a result of the shape effect. The break-up time of the jet also increased because the rate of capillary wave propagation was lower for more viscous liquids. The jet stability graph, which can be drawn in terms of jet retraction and break-up time, was employed to characterize the jetting stability, and the degree of satellite drop generation was quantitatively evaluated by two critical jet speeds. The effect of an electric pulse imposed on a piezoelectric plate inside the printhead was also studied. The single-peak electric pulse was used in this experiment for simple analysis, and the jet speed variation was measured under different operating conditions. Both the optimal dwell time and the maximum stable jetting frequency were affected by viscosity and they were explained in terms of the propagation theory.},

For the first time aviation enthusiasts - both specialists and popular readers alike - possess an authoritative history of aerodynamic theory.

The book touches on all the major theorists and their contributions and, most important, the historical context in which they worked to move the science of aerodynamics forward.' Von Hardesty, Smithsonian Institution From the reviews: 'Something of the unexpected quality of this book can be inferred from its full title A History of Aerodynamics and Its Impact on Flying Machines. Pilots tend to suppose that the science of aerodynamics began empirically, somewhere around the time of Lilienthal and the Wrights, and that aerodynamics and manned flight are roughly coeval. It is therefore surprising to come upon a photograph of the Wright Flyer as late as page 242 of the 478-page volume.'

The thin film pattern replicates the substrate surface energy pattern closely only when (a) the periodicity of the substrate pattern lies between {$\lambda$}h and 2{$\lambda$}h and (b) the less wettable stripe width is within a range bounded by a lower critical length, below which no heterogeneous rupture occurs, and an upper transition length, above which complex morphological features bearing little resemblance to the substrate pattern are formed. The thin film pattern on a periodic physically heterogeneous surface shows the loss of ideal templating when the periodicity of the surface is smaller than about 0.8 times the spinodal wavelength evaluated at the minimum film thickness.

A new mechanism of dewetting in the presence of heterogeneity is proposed where the instability is engendered by the gradient of intermolecular interactions that lead to a microscale wettability contrast. The time scale of instability, which can be several orders smaller than the spinodal dewetting time scale on homogeneous surfaces, varies inversely with the potential difference induced by the heterogeneity. Heterogeneity can even destabilize spinodally stable films, reduce the time of rupture substantially for thicker films, and decrease the dependence of rupture time on the film thickness. The presence of heterogeneity produces complex and locally ordered morphological features that are not predicted by the spinodal dewetting, for example ``ripples'' and ``castle-moat'' structures, radially symmetric structures, and a lack of undulations before the birth of a hole. The precise morphological pattern selection depends on the size of the heterogeneity, the potential difference caused by the heterogeneity, the film thickness, and also the spinodal characteristics of the substrate. The resulting morphologies can be understood on the basis of simple arguments that consider interplay among these factors.},

  abstract = {Surface directed instability and dewetting in thin films and resulting morphologies are studied using 3D nonlinear simulations based on the equations of motion, both for the isotropic and anisotropic 2D substrate patterns. Three different substrate (wettability) patterns are considered:\, (a) arrays of more (or completely) wettable rectangular blocks on a less wettable substrate, (b) arrays of less wettable blocks on a more (or completely) wettable substrate, and (c) a checkerboard pattern of alternating more and less wettable blocks. An ideal replication of the surface energy pattern produces an ordered 2D array of liquid columns (in case 1), or a matrix of holes on a flat liquid sheet (in case 2), or a checkerboard pattern of alternating liquid columns and holes/depressions (in case 3). The effects of pattern periodicity, domain widths, anisotropy, and wettability on the morphological phase transitions are presented. Regardless of the precise geometry of the substrate pattern, templating is found to be better on a completely wettable substrate containing the less wettable blocks, rather than on a less wettable substrate having more wettable blocks. Complete wettability (zero contact angle at all thicknesses), of either the blocks or their surroundings, ensures the pinning of the liquid contact line at the block boundaries. Thus, complete wettability leads to better templating compared to partially wettable substrates. Ideal templating is found possible only when the following conditions are met:\, (a) the periodicity (Lpx and Lpy) of the pattern is more than {$\lambda$}h; where {$\lambda$}h is a characteristic length scale found to be close to the spinodal length scale of the less wettable part, {$\lambda$}m, (b) the less wettable area fraction, Af, should be less than a transition value beyond which the liquid spills over the less wettable part leading to a morphological transition from discrete columnar structure to continuous liquid ridges, (c) less wettable block/channel width should be less than a transition length scale ({$\sim$}0.5{$\lambda$}m), and (d) the aspect ratio of the periodicity intervals (Lpx/Lpy) should be close to 1. Anisotropy in the substrate periodicity leads to stripe-like liquid patterns whenever either Lpx or Lpy is less than {$\lambda$}h. Large values of periodicity lead to the formation of novel ``block mountain-rift valley'' or ``flower'' like microstructures that do not replicate the substrate energy pattern. Interestingly, the near ideal templating of more complex substrate patterns, e.g., alphabets, is also guided by the above conditions.},

  abstract = {Due to capillarity, sessile droplets of identical liquids will instantaneously fuse when they come in contact at their three-phase lines. However, with drops of different, completely miscible liquids, instantaneous coalescence can be suppressed. Instead, the drops remain in a state of noncoalescence for some time, with the two drop bodies connected only by a thin neck. The reason for this noncoalescence is the surface tension difference, {$\Delta\gamma$}, between the liquids. If {$\Delta\gamma$} is sufficiently large, then it induces a sufficiently strong Marangoni flow, which keeps the main drop bodies temporarily separated. Studies with spreading drops have revealed that the boundary between instantaneous coalescence and noncoalescence is sharp (Karpitschka, S.; Riegler, H. J. Fluid. Mech. 2014, 743, R1). The boundary is a function of two parameters only: {$\Delta\gamma$} and {$\overline{\Theta}$}a, the arithmetic mean of the contact angles in the moment of drop\textendash drop contact. It appears plausible that surface forces (the disjoining pressure) could also influence the coalescence behavior. However, in experiments with spreading drops, surface forces always promote coalescence and their influence might be obscured. Therefore, we present here coalescence experiments with partially wetting liquids and compare the results to the spreading case. We adjust different equilibrium contact angles (i.e., different surface forces) with different substrate surface coatings. As for spreading drops, we observe a sharp boundary between regimes of coalescence and noncoalescence. The boundary follows the same power law relation for both partially and completely wetting cases. Therefore, we conclude that surface forces have no significant, explicit influence on the coalescence behavior of sessile drops from different miscible liquids.},

Rather, intermediate noncoalescence is observed. Two separate drop bodies, connected by a thin liquid neck, move over the substrate. Supported by new experimental data, a thin film hydrodynamic analysis of this state is presented. Presumably advective and diffusive volume fluxes in the neck region establish a localized and temporarily stable surface tension gradient. This induces a local surface (Marangoni) flow that stabilizes a traveling wave, i.e., the observed moving twin drop configuration. The theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with the experimental findings.},

In particular, the stability analysis is addressed to layered materials in plane and spherical geometries under various dynamical conditions, to inhomogeneous media with variable gradients and different boundary conditions, to viscous boundary layers, compressible atmospheres, and to stationary ablation fronts in laser-driven plasma experiments. The stability theory is further extended to the nonlinear stage of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability and to a discussion of bubble dynamics in two and three dimensions for closed and open bubble domains. For this purpose simple flow models are studied that can describe essential features of bubble rise and bubble growth in buoyancy-driven mixing layers.},

The reader is then introduced to the equations of motion of a viscous fluid; energy dissipation in an incompressible fluid; damping of gravity waves; and the mechanism whereby turbulence occurs. The following chapters explore the laminar boundary layer; thermal conduction in fluids; dynamics of diffusion of a mixture of fluids; and the phenomena that occur near the surface separating two continuous media. The energy and momentum of sound waves; the direction of variation of quantities in a shock wave; one- and two-dimensional gas flow; and the intersection of surfaces of discontinuity are also also considered.

At the pore level, in drainage, the invading fluid chooses the largest throat. In imbibition, the displacement depends on the local geometry. For a large pore-to-throat ratio (aspect ratio), the main mechanism is the collapse of the invading fluid in the smallest channel, without entering the pore. For a small aspect ratio, the wetting fluid invades the pore first, and then the adjacent channels. From observations at the pore level, the author has modelled the displacement on a large scale in some extreme cases by using statistical theories. The different behaviours are then displayed as domains in three phase diagrams: one for drainage and two for imbibition (large and small aspect ratios). At a high rate, when viscous forces are dominant, all the diagrams show a stable domain (described by anti-DLA) and a viscous fingering domain (DLA). In drainage, low capillary numbers lead to capillary fingering represented by invasion percolation. In imbibition, the capillary domain is described either by a compact cluster growth (small aspect ratio) or percolation theory (large aspect ratio). In addition the possibility of flow by film along the roughness of the walls leads to disconnected structures.},

Adaptation results in an increase in contact angle hysteresis and influences the mobility of sliding drops on surfaces. To study adaptation and its kinetics, we synthesized a random copolymer composed of styrene and 11\textendash 25 mol\% acrylic acid (PS/PAA). We measured the dynamic advancing (\texttheta A) and receding (\texttheta R) contact angles of water drops sliding down a tilted plate coated with this polymer. We measured \texttheta A {$\approx$} 87\textdegree{} for velocities of the contact line {$<$}20 {$\mu$}m/s. At higher velocities, \texttheta A gradually increased to {$\sim$}98\textdegree. This value is similar to \texttheta A of a pure polystyrene (PS) film, which we studied for comparison. We associate the gradual increase in \texttheta A to the adaptation process to water: The presence of water leads to swelling and/or an enrichment of acid groups at the water/polymer interface. By applying the latest adaptation theory (Butt et al. Langmuir 2018, 34, 11292), we estimated the time constant of this adaptation process to be {$\ll$}1 s. For sliding water drops, \texttheta R is {$\sim$}10\textdegree{} lower compared to the reference PS surface for all tested velocities. Thus, at the receding side of a sliding drop, the surface is already enriched by acid groups. For a water drop with a width of 5 mm, the increase in contact angle hysteresis corresponds to an increase in capillary force in the range of 45\textendash 60 {$\mu$}N, depending on sliding velocity.},

  abstract = {Proper approximation of the force terms, especially the bed slope term, is of crucial importance to simulating shallow water flows in lattice Boltzmann (LB) models. However, there is little discussion on the schemes of adding force terms to LB models for shallow water equations (SWEs). In this study, we evaluate the performance of forcing schemes coupled with different LB models (LABSWE and MLBSWE) in simulating shallow water flows over complex topography and try to find out their intrinsic characteristics and applicability. Three cases are adopted for evaluation, including a stationary case, a one-dimensional tidal wave flow over an irregular bed, and a steady flow over a two-dimensional seamount. The simulating results are compared with analytical solutions or the results produced by the finite difference method. For LABSWE, all the forcing schemes, except for the weighting factor method, fail to produce accurate solutions for the test cases; this is probably due to the mismatch between the bed slope term in source terms and the quadratic depth term of the equilibrium distribution functions in these forcing schemes. For MLBSWE, all the forcing schemes are capable of simulating flows over the complex topography accurately; furthermore, those schemes taking into account the collision effect {$\tau$} to eliminate the momentum induced by forces provide more accurate solutions with quicker convergence as the lattice size decreases. In this view, MLBSWE can bring more flexibility in treating the force terms and thus can be a better tool to simulate shallow water flows over complex topography in practical application.},

To reveal an atom-scale mechanism of coalescence or non-coalescence, dynamic behaviors of two conducting nanodroplets at a homogeneous electric field are studied via molecular dynamics simulations in this work. The results show that there is a critical field strength and a critical cone angle above which the two droplets partially coalesce or bounce off. Charge transfer between the two droplets is observed when the droplets are brought into contact. The partial coalescence and the bounce-off of the two droplets at strong field strengths are found to be due to the high charge transfer rate, which leads to the breakup of the coalescing droplet at different locations.}

Going beyond this simple case, we summarize how LBM can be used to treat complex and active fluids. We then review recent developments concerning some relevant topics in active matter that have been studied by means of LBM: spontaneous flow, self-propelled droplets, active emulsions, rheology, active turbulence, and active colloids.},

In this work, we compare the results obtained by using the long-wave model and by simulating directly the full two-phase Navier-Stokes equations employing a volume-of-fluid method. In order to isolate the influence of the small slope assumption inherent in the long-wave theory, we present a quantitative comparison between the two methods in the regime where inertial effects and the influence of gas phase are negligible. The flow geometries that we consider include wetting and dewetting drops within a broad range of equilibrium contact angles in planar and axisymmetric geometries, as well as liquid rings. For perfectly wetting spreading drops we find good quantitative agreement between the models, with both of them following rather closely Tanner's law. For partially wetting drops, while in general we find good agreement between the two models for small equilibrium contact angles, we also uncover differences which are particularly evident in the initial stages of evolution, for retracting drops, and when additional azimuthal curvature is considered. The contracting rings are also found to evolve differently for the two models, with the main difference being that the evolution occurs on the faster time scale when the long-wave model is considered, although the ring shapes are very similar between the two models.},

We show that the interaction forces lead to a partial wetting condition and in particular to a natural definition of the equilibrium contact angle. We present two numerical methods to discretize the interaction forces that enter the model; these two approaches differ in complexity and convergence. To validate the computational framework, we consider the application of these models to simulate two-dimensional drops at equilibrium, as well as drop spreading. We demonstrate that the model, by including the underlying physics, captures contact line dynamics for arbitrary contact angles.

For large wavelengths and no driving force, within perturbation theory, an analytical expression of the growth rate of pearling instabilities is derived. A numerical analysis shows that a body force along the ridge further stabilizes the ridge by reducing the growth rate of unstable perturbations, even though there is no complete stabilization. Hence the stability criteria established in the absence of driven flow ensure overall stability.},

By deriving a stochastic thin film equation with a conserved noise term we show that the spectrum of capillary waves changes from an exponential decay to a power law kBT/({$\gamma$}q2) for large wavevectors q due to thermal fluctuations at temperature T. Also the time evolution of film roughness {$\sigma$}(t) and of the typical wavevector k(t) of unstable perturbations changes qualitatively.

Here, we discuss two fundamental flaws in the definition of these parameters that significantly affect their interpretation for studies of disordered systems, and offer a remedy. First, the definition of the bond-orientational order parameters considers the geometrical arrangement of a set of nearest neighboring (NN) spheres, NN(p), around a given central particle p; we show that the choice of neighborhood definition can have a bigger influence on both the numerical values and qualitative trend of ql than a change of the physical parameters, such as packing fraction. Second, the discrete nature of neighborhood implies that NN(p) is not a continuous function of the particle coordinates; this discontinuity, inherited by ql, leads to a lack of robustness of the ql as structure metrics. Both issues can be avoided by a morphometric approach leading to the robust Minkowski structure metrics q {${'}$} l . These q {${'}$} l  are of a similar mathematical form as the conventional bond-orientational order parameters and are mathematically equivalent to the recently introduced Minkowski tensors [G. E.

We numerically implement matched asymptotic expansions to construct equilibrium solutions and also investigate how they behave as the disjoining pressure is sent to zero.

We studied various fundamental and applied aspects of equilibrium liquid surface morphologies both theoretically and experimentally. Our theoretical analysis showed that surface profiles on homogeneous surfaces display a diverging curvature in the vicinity of the three phase contact line. The asymptotic contact angle at the contact line is equal to Young's angle, independent of the applied voltage. With respect to the morphology of the liquid surface, contact angle variations achieved by electrowetting are equivalent to those achieved by varying the chemical nature of the substrates, except for electric field-induced distortions in a region close to the contact line. Experimentally, we studied the (global) morphology of liquid microstructure substrates with stripe-shaped electrodes. As the local contact angle is reduced by increasing the applied voltage, liquid droplets elongate along the stripe axis as expected. For droplets on a single surface with a stripe electrode, there is a discontinuous morphological transition where elongated droplets transform into translationally invariant cylinder segments with the contact line pinned along the stripe edge and vice versa. If the liquid is confined between two parallel surfaces with parallel stripe electrodes, the elongation of the droplet and its transformation into a translationally invariant morphology with pinned contact lines is continuous. Experimental results are compared to analytical and numerical models.},

Matched asymptotics are used to describe the dynamic profiles for dewetting films and comparison is given with computational simulations. The motion of the dewetting front shows transitions from being nearly linear in time for no-slip to t2/3 as the slip is increased. For much larger slip lengths the front motion appears to become linear again. Correspondingly, the dewetting profiles undergo a transition from oscillatory to monotone decay into the uniform film layer for large slip. Increasing the slip further, to very large values, is associated with an increasing degree of asymmetry in the structure of the dewetting ridge profile},

Often, it is crucial to be able to control the evolution, and to produce patterns characterized by regularly spaced droplets. While thermal fluctuations are expected to play a role in the dewetting process, their relevance has remained poorly understood, particularly during the nonlinear stages of evolution that involve droplet formation. Within a stochastic lubrication framework, we show that thermal noise substantially influences the process of droplets formation. Stochastic systems feature a smaller number of droplets with a larger variability in size and space distribution, when compared to their deterministic counterparts.

  abstract = {The spontaneous spreading (called superspreading) of aqueous trisiloxane ethoxylate surfactant solutions on hydrophobic solid surfaces is a fascinating phenomenon with several practical applications. For example, the ability of trisiloxane ethoxylate surfactants to enhance the spreading of spray solutions on waxy weed leaf surfaces, such as velvetleaf (Abutilion theophrasti), makes them excellent wetting agents for herbicide applications. The superspreading ability of silicone surfactants has been known for decades, but its mechanism is still not well understood. In this paper, we suggest that the spreading of trisiloxane ethoxylates is controlled by a surface tension gradient, which forms when a drop of surfactant solution is placed on a solid surface. The proposed model suggests that, as the spreading front stretches, the surface tension increases (the surfactant concentration becomes lower) at the front relative to the top of the droplet, thereby establishing a dynamic surface tension gradient. The driving force for spreading is due to the Marangoni effect, and our experiments showed that the higher the gradient, the faster the spreading. A simple model describing the phenomenon of superspreading is presented. We also suggest that the superspreading behavior of trisiloxane ethoxylates is a consequence of the molecular configuration at the air/water surface (i.e. small and compact hydrophobic part), as shown by molecular dynamics modeling. We also found that the aggregates and vesicles formed in trisiloxane solutions do not initiate the spreading process and therefore these structures are not a requirement for the superspreading process.},

Fourier transform analysis of the AFM topographic data at various stages of the film pattern development reveals the presence of quantized surface deformation modes. These modes are excited by the phase separation process when the scale of phase separation becomes commensurate with the period of the striped surface pattern. Thus, higher frequency modes become excited at early stages of phase separation, and these excitations decay with time as the phase separation pattern further coarsens. The film ultimately self-organizes into a periodic structure in which the fundamental mode has the largest amplitude. The influence of film thickness on the film morphology in this late stage is also investigated. A decrease in the film thickness leads to surface patterns that match those of the SAM substrates with increasing resolution. However, these film patterns break up into droplet arrays along the SAM stripes if the films are made too thin. This phenomenon is attributed to a capillary wave instability.},

  abstract = {Macroscopic thin liquid films are entities that are important in biophysics, physics, and engineering, as well as in natural settings. They can be composed of common liquids such as water or oil, rheologically complex materials such as polymers solutions or melts, or complex mixtures of phases or components. When the films are subjected to the action of various mechanical, thermal, or structural factors, they display interesting dynamic phenomena such as wave propagation, wave steepening, and development of chaotic responses. Such films can display rupture phenomena creating holes, spreading of fronts, and the development of fingers. In this review a unified mathematical theory is presented that takes advantage of the disparity of the length scales and is based on the asymptotic procedure of reduction of the full set of governing equations and boundary conditions to a simplified, highly nonlinear, evolution equation or to a set of equations. As a result of this long-wave theory, a mathematical system is obtained that does not have the mathematical complexity of the original free-boundary problem but does preserve many of the important features of its physics. The basics of the long-wave theory are explained. If, in addition, the Reynolds number of the flow is not too large, the analogy with Reynolds's theory of lubrication can be drawn. A general nonlinear evolution equation or equations are then derived and various particular cases are considered. Each case contains a discussion of the linear stability properties of the base-state solutions and of the nonlinear spatiotemporal evolution of the interface (and other scalar variables, such as temperature or solute concentration). The cases reducing to a single highly nonlinear evolution equation are first examined. These include: (a) films with constant interfacial shear stress and constant surface tension, (b) films with constant surface tension and gravity only, (c) films with van der Waals (long-range molecular) forces and constant surface tension only, (d) films with thermocapillarity, surface tension, and body force only, (e) films with temperature-dependent physical properties, (f) evaporating/condensing films, (g) films on a thick substrate, (h) films on a horizontal cylinder, and (i) films on a rotating disc. The dynamics of the films with a spatial dependence of the base-state solution are then studied. These include the examples of nonuniform temperature or heat flux at liquid-solid boundaries. Problems which reduce to a set of nonlinear evolution equations are considered next. Those include (a) the dynamics of free liquid films, (b) bounded films with interfacial viscosity, and (c) dynamics of soluble and insoluble surfactants in bounded and free films. The spreading of drops on a solid surface and moving contact lines, including effects of heat and mass transport and van der Waals attractions, are then addressed. Several related topics such as falling films and sheets and Hele-Shaw flows are also briefly discussed. The results discussed give motivation for the development of careful experiments which can be used to test the theories and exhibit new phenomena.},

Few simple illumination parameters are controlled to induce nontrivial wetting effects. Wetting anisotropy with controlled directionality, unidirectional spreading, and even polarization-intensity driven two-dimensional paths for wetting anisotropy are obtained starting from a single pristine pillar geometry. The obtained results prove that the versatility of the light-reconfiguration process, together with the possibility of reversible reshaping at reduced costs, represents a valid approach for both applications and fundamental studies in the field of geometry-based wettability of solid surfaces.},

  abstract = {A uniform nanometric thin liquid film on a solid substrate can become unstable due to the action of van der Waals (vdW) forces. The instability leads to dewetting of the uniform film and the formation of drops. To minimize the total free energy of the system, these drops coarsen over time until one single drop remains. Here, using a thermodynamically consistent framework, we derive a new model for thin films in partial wetting with a free energy that resembles the Cahn\textendash Hilliard form with a height-dependent surface tension that leads to a generalized disjoining pressure, and revisit the dewetting problem. Using both linear stability analysis and nonlinear simulations we show that the new model predicts a slightly smaller critical instability wavelength and a significantly (up to six-fold) faster growth rate than the classical model in the spinodal regime; this faster growth rate brings the theoretical predictions closer to published experimental observations. During coarsening at intermediate times, the dynamics become self-similar and model-independent; we therefore observe the same scalings in both the classical (with and without thermal noise) and new models. Both models also lead to a mean-field Lifshitz\textendash Slyozov\textendash Wagner (LSW)-type droplet-size distribution at intermediate times for small drop sizes. We, however, observe a skewed drop-size distribution for larger drops in the new model; while the tail of the distribution follows a Smoluchowski equation, it is not associated with a coalescence-dominated coarsening, calling into question the association made in some earlier experiments. Our observations point to the importance of the height dependence of surface tension in the early and late stages of dewetting of nanometric films and motivate new high-resolution experimental observations to guide the development of improved models of interfacial flows at the nanoscale.},

  abstract = {We present an investigation of symmetric and asymmetric coalescence of two droplets of equal and unequal size on a solid surface in the inertia-dominated regime. Asymmetric coalescence can result due to the coalescence of two unequal-sized droplets or coalescence of two droplets having different contact angles with the surface due to a step gradient in wettability. Based on the solution of an analytical model and lattice Boltzmann simulations, we analyze symmetric and asymmetric coalescence of two droplets on a solid surface. The analysis of coalescence of identical droplets show that the liquid bridge height grows with time as (t*)1/2 for \texttheta{} = 90\textdegree{} and (t*)2/3 for \texttheta{} {$<$} 90\textdegree, where t* is dimensionless time. Our analysis also yields the same scaling law for the coalescence of two unequal-sized droplets on a surface with homogeneous wettability. We also discuss the coalescence of two droplets having different contact angles with the surface due to a step gradient in wettability. We show that the prediction of bridge height with time scales as (t*)2/3 irrespective of contact angles of droplet with the surface.},

  abstract = {The giant tsunami that occurred in the Indian Ocean on 26th December 2004 draws attention to this natural phenomenon. The given course of lectures deals with the physics of the tsunami wave propagation from the source to the coast. Briefly, the geographical distribution of the tsunamis is described and physical mechanisms of their origin are discussed. Simplified robust formulas for the source parameters (dimension and height) are given for tsunamis of different origin. It is shown that the shallow-water theory is an adequate model to describe the tsunamis of the seismic origin; meanwhile for the tsunamis of the landslide or explosion origin (volcanoes, asteroid impact) various theories (from linear dispersive to nonlinear shallow-water equations) can be applied. The applicability of the existing theories to describe the tsunami wave propagation, refraction, transformation and climbing on the coast is demonstrated. Nonlinear-dispersive effects including the role of the solitons are discussed. The practical usage of the tsunami modeling for the tsunami forecasting and tsunami risk evaluation is described. The results of the numerical simulations of the two global tsunamis in the Indian Ocean induced by the catastrophic Krakatau eruption in 1883 and the strongest North Sumatra earthquake in 2004 are given.},

  abstract = {Thin polymer films on hydrophobic substrates are susceptible to rupture and hole formation. This, in turn, initiates a complex dewetting process, which ultimately leads to characteristic droplet patterns. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the type of droplet pattern depends on the specific interfacial condition between the polymer and the substrate. Predicting the morphological evolution over long timescales and on the different length scales involved is a major computational challenge. In this study, a highly adaptive numerical scheme is presented, which allows for following the dewetting process deep into the nonlinear regime of the model equations and captures the complex dynamics, including the shedding of droplets. In addition, our numerical results predict the previously unknown shedding of satellite droplets during the destabilization of liquid ridges that form during the late stages of the dewetting process. While the formation of satellite droplets is well known in the context of elongating fluid filaments and jets, we show here that, for dewetting liquid ridges, this property can be dramatically altered by the interfacial condition between polymer and substrate, namely slip. This work shows how dissipative processes can be used to systematically tune the formation of patterns.},

We study such flows using the canonical set-up of an elastic-walled Hele-Shaw cell whose upper boundary is formed by an elastic sheet. We investigate both single- and two-phase displacement flows in which the localised injection of fluid at a constant flow rate is accommodated by the inflation of the sheet and the outward propagation of an axisymmetric front beyond which the cell remains approximately undeformed. We perform a direct comparison between quantitative experiments and numerical simulations of two theoretical models. The models couple the F\"oppl\textendash von K\'arm\'an equations, which describe the deformation of the thin elastic membrane, to the equations describing the flow, which we model by (i) the Navier\textendash Stokes equations or (ii) lubrication theory. We identify the dominant physical effects that control the behaviour of the system and critically assess modelling assumptions that were made in previous studies. The insight gained from these studies is then used in Part~2 of this work, where we formulate an improved lubrication model and develop an asymptotic description of the key phenomena.},

Non-axisymmetric instabilities are only observed at much larger flow rates, and the large-amplitude fingers that develop are fundamentally different from the highly branched fingers in rigid-walled cells. We explain the mechanism for the suppression of the instability using a combination of linear stability analysis and direct numerical simulations, based on a theoretical model that couples a depth-averaged lubrication equation for the fluid flow to the F\"oppl\textendash von K\'arm\'an equations, which describe the deformation of the elastic membrane. We show that fluid\textendash structure interaction affects the instability primarily via two changes to the axisymmetric base flow: the axisymmetric inflation of the membrane prior to the onset of any instabilities slows down the expansion of the air bubble and forces the air\textendash liquid interface to propagate into a converging fluid-filled gap. Both of these changes reduce the destabilizing viscous effects that drive the fingering instability in a rigid-walled cell. In contrast, capillary effects only play a very minor role in the suppression of the instability.},

The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently\textemdash those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90\% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

In this paper, we will first discuss the existence of staggered invariants, then we propose to use fractional propagation as an effective way of suppressing these undesired invariants.

  abstract = {The article gives an overview of the lattice Boltzmann method as a powerful technique for the simulation of single and multi-phase flows in complex geometries. Owing to its excellent numerical stability and constitutive versatility it can play an essential role as a simulation tool for understanding advanced materials and processes. Unlike conventional Navier\textendash Stokes solvers, lattice Boltzmann methods consider flows to be composed of a collection of pseudo-particles that are represented by a velocity distribution function. These fluid portions reside and interact on the nodes of a grid. System dynamics and complexity emerge by the repeated application of local rules for the motion, collision and redistribution of these coarse-grained droplets. The lattice Boltzmann method, therefore, is an ideal approach for mesoscale and scale-bridging simulations. It is capable to tackling particularly those problems which are ubiquitous characteristics of flows in the world of materials science and engineering, namely, flows under complicated geometrical boundary conditions, multi-scale flow phenomena, phase transformation in flows, complex solid\textendash liquid interfaces, surface reactions in fluids, liquid\textendash solid flows of colloidal suspensions and turbulence. Since the basic structure of the method is that of a synchronous automaton it is also an ideal platform for realizing combinations with related simulation techniques such as cellular automata or Potts models for crystal growth in a fluid or gas environment. This overview consists of two parts. The first one reviews the philosophy and the formal concepts behind the lattice Boltzmann approach and presents also related pseudo-particle approaches. The second one gives concrete examples in the area of computational materials science and process engineering, such as the prediction of lubrication dynamics in metal forming, dendritic crystal growth under the influence of fluid convection, simulation of metal foam processing, flow percolation in confined geometries, liquid crystal hydrodynamics and processing of polymer blends.},

  abstract = {In this paper the dynamics of a two-layered liquid, made of two immiscible shallow-layers of different density, has been investigated within the framework of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The LBM developed in this paper for the two-layered, shallow-water flow has been obtained considering two separate sets of LBM equations, one for each layer. The coupling terms between the two sets have been defined as external forces, acted on one layer by the other. Results obtained from the LBM developed in this paper are compared with numerical results obtained solving the two-layered, shallow-water equations, with experimental and other numerical results published in literature. The results are interesting. First, the numerical results obtained by the LBM and by the shallow-water model can be considered as equivalent. Second, the LBM developed in this paper is able to simulate motion conditions on nonflat topography. Third, the agreement between the LBM (and also shallow-water model) numerical results and the experimental results is good when the evolution of the flow does not depend on the viscosity, that is, during the initial phase of the flow, dominated by gravity and inertia forces. When the viscous forces dominate the evolution of the flow the agreement between numerical and experimental results depends strongly on the viscosity; it is good if the numerical LBM viscosity has the same order of magnitude of the liquid's kinematic viscosity.

The evolution of these structures during the lifetime of the cell remains poorly understood. Herein, a phase-field simulation framework is proposed, handling liquid\textendash liquid demixing and polycrystalline growth at the same time to investigate the evolution of crystalline immiscible binary systems. It is found that initially, the nuclei trigger the spinodal decomposition, whereas the growing crystals quench the phase coarsening in the amorphous mixture. In contrast, the separated liquid phases guide the crystal growth along the domains of high concentration. It is also demonstrated that with a higher crystallization rate, in the final morphology, single crystals are more structured and form percolating pathways for each material with smaller lateral dimensions.},

The number of linearly independent moments of the distribution function in a lattice Boltzmann model cannot exceed the number of velocities; finite dimensionality therefore necessarily induces linear dependences among the moments that do not exist in a continuous theory. Given a finite velocity set, it is important to know which moments are free of these dependences. Elementary group theory is applied to the solution of this problem. It is found that decomposing the velocity set into subsets that transform among themselves under an appropriate symmetry group makes it straightforward to uncover linear dependences among the moments. The construction of some standard two- and three-dimensional models is reviewed from this viewpoint, and procedures for constructing higher-dimensional models are suggested.},

Two-photon lithography (TPL)\textendash based submicrometer additive manufacturing is a promising candidate to fill this gap. However, the serial point-by-point writing scheme of TPL is too slow for many applications. Attempts at parallelization either do not have submicrometer resolution or cannot pattern complex structures. We overcome these difficulties by spatially and temporally focusing an ultrafast laser to implement a projection-based layer-by-layer parallelization. This increases the throughput up to three orders of magnitude and expands the geometric design space. We demonstrate this by printing, within single-digit millisecond time scales, nanowires with widths smaller than 175 nanometers over an area one million times larger than the cross-sectional area.},

This property gives planetary geostrophic dynamics a significant computational advantage over the primitive equations, especially in three dimensions.},

The fraction of the hydrophobic areas has been varied from about 20\% to 80\%. The effects of the heterogeneous patterning can be described by a renormalized value of the critical Bond number, i.e., the critical dimensionless force needed to depin the drop before it starts to move. Close to the critical Bond number we observe a jerky motion characterized by an evident stick-slip dynamics. As a result, dissipation is strongly localized in time, and the mean velocity of the drops can easily decrease by an order of magnitude compared to the sliding on the homogeneous surface. Lattice Boltzmann numerical simulations are crucial for disclosing to what extent the sliding dynamics can be deduced from the computed balance of capillary, viscous, and body forces by varying the Bond number, the surface composition, and the liquid viscosity. Beyond the critical Bond number, we characterize both experimentally and numerically the dissipation inside the droplet by studying the relation between the average velocity and the applied volume forces.},

The contact angle is a prescribed function of position on the substrate. An evolution equation is presented, using the lubrication approximation, that includes viscous, capillary, disjoining, and gravitational forces. Motion to and from dry substrate regions is made possible by use of a thin energetically stable wetting layer. Axisymmetric spreading on a uniform substrate is calculated, and it is found, in agreement with reported experiments, that spreading rates are independent of the contact angle until the drop has almost stabilized. We simulate motion on a heterogeneous substrate composed of two different materials having widely different contact angles. Motion proceeds in an almost discontinuous fashion as the initial droplet breaks up into smaller pieces through the action of the wetting forces. Various forms of the disjoining energy functional are employed; the particular choice is found to have only a limited quantitative effect of the drop dynamics. Experimental observations confirm the basic features of the simulation, although a time-scale correction needs to be applied.},

  abstract = {Dip coating is a simple old way of depositing onto a substrate, especially small slabs and cylinders, a uniform thin film of liquid for solidification into a coating. The basic flow is steady, and in it film thickness is set by the competition among viscous force, capillary (surface tension) force and gravity. Thickness and uniformity can be sensitive to flow conditions in the liquid bath and gas overhead. The faster the substrate is withdrawn, the thicker the film deposited. This can be countered by using volatile solutes and combining rapid enough drying with the basic liquid flow. Then the physics grows more complicated, theoretical prediction of process performance more difficult, and control of the process more demanding. Outside product R\&D labs it is far less often used in precision coating manufacture than a variety of premetered coating methods.Spin coating is a more recently developed way of getting onto piecemeal substrates, especially small flat disks, a uniform thin liquid film for the same end. The basic flow is unsteady radial drainage in which centrifugal and viscous forces so compete that ordinary (Newtonian) liquid of constant viscosity tends toward a uniform film that grows ever thinner ever more slowly. Volatile solvents are commonly used because conditions can often be found that adequately separate thinning by spin-off from later thinning and solidification by drying. Thickness and uniformity, today theoretically predictable, are sensitive to speed, gas conditions, and rheology of concentrating, solidifying liquid. For the rheology of photoresist coating in microelectronics, spin coating works well. For that of suspension coatings in magnetic disk technology the process demands more careful control; actually it is often modified.}

Although the importance in this line has not dimmed, other powerful areas have emerged in the last two or three decades. Much more attention has been drawn to light induced motions triggered by photoreactions utilizing molecular and polymer assemblies. Probably, this field is one of the most developing areas in advanced soft material research. This review article mainly deals with azobenzene and diarylethene as the photochroms, and systematically introduces light triggered dynamic processes taking place at interfaces. In terms of the feature size, the systems at interfaces, mesoscopic and microscopic level materials are particularly highlighted.

  abstract = {Thermal fluctuations have been shown to influence the thinning dynamics of planar thin liquid films, bringing predicted rupture times closer to experiments. Most liquid films in nature and industry are, however, non-planar. Thinning of such films not just results from the interplay between stabilizing surface tension forces and destabilizing van der Waals forces, but also from drainage due to curvature differences. This work explores the influence of thermal fluctuations on the dynamics of thin non-planar films subjected to drainage, with their dynamics governed by two parameters: the strength of thermal fluctuations, {$\mathsl{\theta}\theta\backslash$}unicode[STIX]\{x1D703\}, and the strength of drainage, {$\mathsl{K}\kappa\backslash$}unicode[STIX]\{x1D705\}. For strong drainage ({$\mathsl{K}\gg\mathsl{K}$}tr{$\kappa\gg\kappa$}tr\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D705\}\textbackslash gg \textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D705\}\_\{tr\}), we find that the film ruptures due to the formation of a local depression called a dimple that appears at the connection between the curved and flat parts of the film. For this dimple-dominated regime, the rupture time, trtrt\_\{r\}, solely depends on {$\mathsl{K}\kappa\backslash$}unicode[STIX]\{x1D705\}, according to the earlier reported scaling, tr{$\sim\mathsl{K}-$}10/7tr{$\sim\kappa-$}10/7t\_\{r\}\textbackslash sim \textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D705\}\^\{-10/7\}. By contrast, for weak drainage ({$\mathsl{K}\ll\mathsl{K}$}tr{$\kappa\ll\kappa$}tr\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D705\}\textbackslash ll \textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D705\}\_\{tr\}), the film ruptures at a random location due to the spontaneous growth of fluctuations originating from thermal fluctuations. In this fluctuations-dominated regime, the rupture time solely depends on {$\mathsl{\theta}\theta\backslash$}unicode[STIX]\{x1D703\} as tr{$\sim-$}(1/{$\mathsl{\omega}$}max)ln({$\surd$}2{$\mathsl{\theta}$}){$\mathsl{A}$}tr{$\sim-$}(1/{$\omega$}max)ln(2\texttheta --{$\surd$}){$\alpha$}t\_\{r\}\textbackslash sim -(1/\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D714\}\_\{max\})\textbackslash ln (\textbackslash sqrt\{2\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D703\}\})\^\{\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D6FC\}\}, with {$\mathsl{A}$}=1.15{$\alpha$}=1.15\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D6FC\}=1.15. This scaling is rationalized using linear stability theory, which yields {$\mathsl{\omega}$}max{$\omega$}max\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D714\}\_\{max\} as the growth rate of the fastest-growing wave and {$\mathsl{A}$}=1{$\alpha$}=1\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D6FC\}=1. These insights on if, when and how thermal fluctuations play a role are instrumental in predicting the dynamics and rupture time of non-flat draining thin films.},

The resulting macroscopic moment equations at each level of the systematic discretization give rise to the Navier\textendash Stokes hydrodynamics and those beyond. In addition, theoretical indications to the order of accuracy requirements are given for each discrete approximation, for thermohydrodynamic systems, and for fluid systems involving long-range interactions. All these are important for complex and micro-scale flows and are missing in the conventional Navier\textendash Stokes order descriptions. The resulting discrete Boltzmann models are based on a kinetic representation of the fluid dynamics, hence the drawbacks in conventional higher-order hydrodynamic formulations can be avoided.}

The wire meshes currently utilized for fog harvesting suffer from dual constraints: coarse meshes cannot efficiently capture microscopic fog droplets, whereas fine meshes suffer from clogging issues. Here, we design and fabricate fog harvesters comprising an array of vertical wires, which we call ``fog harps''. Under controlled laboratory conditions, the fog-harvesting rates for fog harps with three different wire diameters were compared to conventional meshes of equivalent dimensions. As expected for the mesh structures, the mid-sized wires exhibited the largest fog collection rate, with a drop-off in performance for the fine or coarse meshes. In contrast, the fog-harvesting rate continually increased with decreasing wire diameter for the fog harps due to efficient droplet shedding that prevented clogging. This resulted in a 3-fold enhancement in the fog-harvesting rate for the harp design compared to an equivalent mesh.},

Experimental data show that a droplet placed on the micro-grooved aluminum surface using a micro-syringe exhibits an increased apparent contact angle, and for droplets condensed on these etched surfaces, more than a 50\% reduction in the volume needed for the onset of droplet sliding is manifest. No chemical surface treatment is necessary to achieve this water repellency; it is accomplished solely by an anisotropic surface morphology that manipulates droplet geometry and creates and exploits discontinuities in the three-phase contact line. These micro-structured surfaces are proposed for use in a broad range of air-cooling applications, where the management of condensate and defrost liquid on the heat transfer surface is essential to the energy-efficient operation of the machine.},

  abstract = {The stability of an evaporating thin liquid film on a solid substrate is investigated within lubrication theory. The heat flux due to evaporation induces thermal gradients; the generated Marangoni stresses are accounted for. Assuming the gas phase at rest, the dynamics of the vapour reduces to diffusion. The boundary condition at the interface couples transfer from the liquid to its vapour and diffusion flux. The evolution of the film is governed by a lubrication equation coupled with the Laplace problem associated with quasi-static diffusion. The linear stability of a flat film is studied in this general framework. The subsequent analysis is restricted to diffusion-limited evaporation for which the gas phase is saturated in vapour in the vicinity of the interface. The stability depends then only on two control parameters, the capillary and Marangoni numbers. The Marangoni effect is destabilizing whereas capillarity and evaporation are stabilizing processes. The results of the linear stability analysis are compared with the experiments of Poulard et al. (2003) performed in a different geometry. In order to study the resulting patterns, an amplitude equation is obtained through a systematic multiple-scale expansion. The evaporation rate is needed and is computed perturbatively by solving the Laplace problem for the diffusion of vapour. The bifurcation from the flat state is found to be a supercritical transition. Moreover, it appears that the non-local nature of the diffusion problem affects the amplitude equation unusually.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of thin liquid films on surfaces whose wettability changes in a time-periodic manner are examined in this work. A nonlinear evolution equation based on the lubrication approximation is used to describe the film height, and attractions due to van der Waals forces are incorporated. Film wettability is varied through an imposed sinusoidal modulation of the Hamaker constant. A linear stability analysis predicts that if the mean Hamaker constant is negative, disturbances at the film surface will eventually decay regardless of the amplitude and frequency of the oscillation. However, numerical solution of the evolution equation shows that the film can rupture at a given frequency if the amplitude is sufficiently large. The associated characteristic wavelength can be predicted from results for constant-wettability surfaces if an appropriate effective Hamaker constant is used. For positive mean Hamaker constants, film rupture can be accelerated, delayed, or prevented depending on how the Hamaker constant changes early in the oscillation cycle. The effects of spatial gradients in wettability are also considered, and it is found that oscillation can delay but not prevent rupture. Inclusion of short-range repulsive forces leads to the formation of droplet-like structures separated by ultra-thin films, but this can be prevented by sufficiently large and slow oscillations of the Hamaker constant. The results of this work may find use in applications that make use of surfaces whose wettability can be controlled by external stimuli.},

This relation leads to others governing the variation of drop size and slope with time. The predictions are compared with experiment, using silicone oils, and good agreement obtained. The lubrication approximation theory gives no solution for thicknesses below a value varying from 2 to 9*10-8 m at the drop edge.

  abstract = {A theory of the wetting of solids by liquids is put forward. The theory accounts for capillary pressure gradient, gravitational potential gradient, surface tension gradient, disjoining pressure gradient driving forces of flow in thick thin-films and of surface diffusion in thin thin-films. Disjoining pressure stems from the way intermolecular forces aggregate in submicroscopically thin films. For thick thin-films of slowly varying thickness the lubrication approximation to velocity distributions is appropriate. With this approximation the spontaneous, unsteady, two-dimensional spreading of liquid is shown to be governed by a nonlinear convective-diffusion equation for the evolution of the film thickness profile. The predictions of the theory agree with Marmur and Lelah's (1980, 1981) observations of water drops spreading on glass and with Bascom, Cottington and Singleterry's (1964) and Ludviksson and Lightfoot's (1971) observations of oils spreading on high energy surfaces. The theory is used to analyze Derjaguin and co-workers' (1944, 1957, 1970) blowing-off experiments designed to measure thin-film rheology. The theory is also used to buttress the proposition that much contact angle hysteresis is due simply to slow attainment of equilibrium.},

There, liquid absorption into the brush results in swelling of the brush causing changes in the brush topography and wettability. The liquid may also advance within the brush via diffusion (or wicking) resulting in coupled drop and brush dynamics. The specific model accounts for coupled spreading, absorption and wicking dynamics when the underlying energy functional incorporates capillarity, wettability and brush energy. After employing a simple version of such a model to numerically simulate a droplet spreading on a swelling brush we conclude with a discussion of possible model extensions.},

The multilayer LB model avoids the expensive Navier\textendash Stokes equations and obtains stratified horizontal flow velocities as vertical velocities are relatively small and the flow is still within the shallow water regime. A single relaxation time BGK method is used to solve each layer coupled by the vertical viscosity forcing term. To increase solution stability, an implicit step is suggested to obtain flow velocities. The main advantage of using the LBM is that after selecting appropriate equilibrium distribution functions, the LB algorithm is only slightly modified for each layer and retains all the simplicities of the LBM within the high performance computing (HPC) environment. The performance of the parallel LB model for the multilayer shallow water equations is investigated on CPU-based HPC environments using OpenMP. We found that the explicit loop control with cache optimization in LBM gives better performance on execution time, speedup and efficiency than the implicit loop control as the number of processors increases. Numerical examples are presented to verify the multilayer LB model against analytical solutions. We demonstrate the model's capability of calculating lateral and vertical distributions of velocities for wind-driven circulation over non-uniform bathymetry.},

It is concluded that the interaction must be associated with an increase of the free energy, leading to a repulsion between the particles. The repulsive potential calculated from a consideration of the free energy for certain special cases has been combined with the London-van der Waals attractive potential calculated by Hamaker to obtain curves of potential vs. distance. Predictions based on these curves appear to agree well with various experimental data. For example, the influence of electrolyte concentration and of the valencies of the ions on flocculation is satisfactorily explained in terms of the theory, although many complicated phenomena remain to be correlated with it.},

  abstract = {Background: Teacher stress potentially impairs personal and professional competence and compromises productivity. Aversive emotional experience has been most comprehensively encapsulated by the phenomenon of burnout, which is particularly prominent for staff in human service sectors. Burnout reactions have been characterised as tripartite: the depletion of emotional reserves (emotional exhaustion), an increasingly cynical and negative approach towards others (depersonalisation) and a growing feeling of work-related dissatisfaction (personal accomplishment). Purpose: Few studies have investigated the emotional consequences of teachers' stress and even fewer have specifically focused on university educators. A systematic literature review was thus conducted to evaluate the extent of burnout for university teaching staff and specifically to reveal predictive variables, which may explain this experience in this understudied occupational group. Design and methods: Six databases including Educational Resources Information Centre (ERIC), PsychINFO and Scopus were searched using the terms burnout, university, academics, teaching staff, lecturers, research staff and faculty. Papers were limited to English language peer-reviewed empirical investigations ofburnout in full-time university teaching staff. Papers not adopting a clear operationalisation of burnout were rejected. Twelve papers met the criteria and were included in the review. A detailed data extraction form was used to reveal relevant information from each paper. Conclusions: The review revealed that staff exposure to high numbers of students, especially tuition of postgraduates, strongly predicts the experience of burnout. Other predictive variables included gender, with higher depersonalisation scores found in male teachers and female teachers typically scoring higher onthe emotional exhaustion dimension. Age also demonstrated an association, with younger staff appearing more vulnerable to emotional exhaustion. Burnout in university teachers was comparable with other service sector employees such asschoolteachers and healthcare professionals. The current review reveals a scarcity of comparative studies across different university contexts, therefore multi-site studies are required in order to control for the potential influence ofmoderating variables such as institution age when measuring burnout in university teachers.},

  abstract = {Large-scale molecular dynamics simulations are used to model the dewetting of solid surfaces by partially wetting thin liquid films. Two levels of solid-liquid interaction are considered that give rise to large equilibrium contact angles. The initial length and thickness of the films are varied over a wide range at the nanoscale. Spontaneous dewetting is initiated by removing a band of molecules either from each end of the film or from its center. As observed experimentally and in previous simulations, the films recede at an initially constant speed, creating a growing rim of liquid with a constant receding dynamic contact angle. Consistent with the current understanding of wetting dynamics, film recession is faster on the more poorly wetted surface to an extent that cannot be explained solely by the increase in the surface tension driving force. In addition, the rates of recession of the thinnest films are found to increase with decreasing film thickness. These new results imply not only that the mobility of the liquid molecules adjacent to the solid increases with decreasing solid-liquid interactions, but also that the mobility adjacent to the free surface of the film is higher than in the bulk, so that the effective viscosity of the film decreases with thickness.},

While thin liquid ridges are stable both statically and during flow, a (linear) pearling instability develops if the thickness of the ridge exceeds half of the width of the channel. In the flowing case, periodic bulges propagate along the channel and subsequently merge due to nonlinear effects. However, the ridge does not break up even when the flow is unstable, and the qualitative behavior is unchanged even when the fluid can spill over onto a partially wetting exterior solid region.},

The final goal is the formation of droplets of all kinds of fluids with any desired volume, velocity, and a reliability as high as possible. The physics behind the chain of processes comprise the two-way coupling from the electrical to the mechanical domain through the piezoelectric actuator, where an electrical signal is transformed into a mechanical deformation of the printhead structure. The next two steps are the coupling to the acoustic domain inside the ink channels, and the coupling to the fluid dynamic domain, i.e.~the drop formation process. The dynamics of the printhead structure are coupled via the acoustics to the drop formation process in the nozzle. Furthermore, wetting of the nozzle plate and air bubbles can have a negative influence on the printhead performance. The five topics (actuation, channel acoustics, drop formation, wetting, and air bubbles) are reviewed in this paper. This research connects the product developments for many emerging new industrial applications of the inkjet technology to the fundamental physical phenomena underlying the printhead operation.},

Therefore, the long-time dynamics of a large drop ensemble is governed by a balance of merging and splitting. We employ a long-wave film height evolution equation and determine the dynamics of the drop size distribution towards a stationary state from direct numerical simulations on large domains. The main features of the distribution are then related to the bifurcation diagram of individual drops obtained by numerical path continuation. The gained knowledge allows us to develop a Smoluchowski-type statistical model for the ensemble dynamics that well compares to full direct simulations.},

This strongly nonlinear partial differential equation is solved by numerical methods as part of an initial-value problem for periodic boundary conditions in x, the lateral space dimension. Given this model, one obtains true rupture in the sense that the film thickness becomes zero in a finite time.

The cases are presented in order of complexity. They consist of advection across the poles, steady state geostrophically balanced flow of both global and local scales, forced nonlinear advection of an isolated low, zonal flow impinging on an isolated mountain, Rossby-Haurwitz waves, and observed atmospheric states.

  abstract = {Superamphiphobic surfaces are commonly associated with superior anticontamination and antifouling properties. Visually, this is justified by their ability to easily shed off drops and contaminants. However, on micropillar arrays, tiny droplets are known to remain on pillars' top faces while the drop advances. This raises the question of whether remnants remain even on nanostructured superamphiphobic surfaces. Are superamphiphobic surfaces really self-cleaning? Here we investigate the presence of microdroplet contaminants on three nanostructured superamphiphobic surfaces. After brief contact with liquids having different volatilities and surface tension (water, ethylene glycol, hexadecane, and an ionic liquid), confocal microscopy reveals a ``blanket-like'' layer of microdroplets remaining on the surface. It appears that the phenomenon is universal. Notably, when placing subsequent drops onto the contaminated surface, they are still able to roll off. However, adhesion forces can gradually increase by up to 3 times after repeated liquid drop contact. Therefore, we conclude that superamphiphobic surfaces do not warrant self-cleaning and anticontamination capabilities at sub-micrometric length scales.},

  abstract = {It has already been asserted, by Mr. Monge and others, that the phenomena of capillary tubes are referable to the cohesive attraction of the superficial particles only of the fluids em\-ployed, and that the surfaces must consequently be formed into curves of the nature of lintearias, which are supposed to be the results of a uniform tension of a surface, resisting the pressure of a fluid, either uniform, or varying according to a given law. Segner, who appears to have been the first that maintained a similar opinion, has shown in what manner the principle may be deduced from the doctrine of attraction, but his demonstration is complicated, and not perfectly satisfactory; and in applying the law to the forms of drops, he has neglected to consider the very material effects of the double curvature, which is evidently the cause of the want of a perfect coinci\-dence of some of his experiments with his theory. Since the time of Segner, little has been done in investigating accurately and in detail the various consequences of the principle. It will perhaps be most agreeable to the experimental phi\-losopher, although less consistent with the strict course of logical argument, to proceed in the first place to the comparison of this theory with the phenomena, and to inquire afterwards for its foundation in the ultimate properties of matter. But it is necessary to premise one observation, which appears to be new, and which is equally consistent with theory and with experiment; that is, that for each combination of a solid and a fluid, there is an appropriate angle of contact between the surfaces of the fluid, exposed to the air, and to the solid. This angle, for glass and water, and in all cases where a solid is perfectly wetted by a fluid, is evanescent: for glass and mer\-cury, it is about 140\textdegree, in common temperatures, and when the mercury is moderately clean.},

  abstract = {The preparation of biomimetic superhydrophobic surfaces with hydrophilic micro-sized patterns is highly desirable, but a one-step, mask-free method to produce such surfaces has not previously been reported. We have developed a direct method to produce superhydrophilic micropatterns on superhydrophobic surfaces based on inkjet printing technology. This work was inspired by the efficient fog-harvesting behavior of Stenocara beetles in the Namib Desert. A mussel-inspired ink consisting of an optimized solution of dopamine was applied directly by inkjet printing to superhydrophobic surfaces. Stable Wenzel's microdroplets of the dopamine solution with well-defined micropatterns were obtained on these surfaces. Superhydrophilic micropatterns with well-controlled dimensions were then readily achieved on the superhydrophobic surfaces by the formation of polydopamine via in situ polymerization. The micropatterned superhydrophobic surfaces prepared by this inkjet printing method showed enhanced water collection efficiency compared with uniform superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces. This method can be used for the facile large-scale patterning of superhydrophobic surfaces with high precision and superior pattern stability and is therefore a key step toward patterning superhydrophobic surfaces for practical applications.},

A linear stability analysis of the STF allows us to derive a power spectrum for the surface fluctuations, which is quantitatively validated against the spectrum observed in MD. Thermal fluctuations are shown to be critical to the dynamics of nanoscale films. Compared to the classical instability mechanism, which is driven by disjoining pressure, fluctuations (a) can massively amplify the instability, (b) cause the fluctuation wavelength that is dominant to evolve in time (a single fastest-growing mode does not exist), and (c) decrease the critical wavelength so that classically stable films can be ruptured.},

Analytically derived capillary spectra, which evolve in time, are found from the new SLEs and compared to molecular dynamics simulations. It is shown that thermal fluctuations lead to the generation and growth of surface waves, and slip accelerates this growth. SLEs developed here provide useful tools to study nanoscale film dewetting, nanofiber coating, and liquid transport using nanofibers.},

By employing characteristic lubricant relaxation times in all order of magnitude analysis, a perturbation method is developed to analyze the flow of a non-Newtonian lubricant between two surfaces. The effect of viscoelasticity on the lubricant velocity and pressure fields is examined, and the influence of minimum film thickness on lubrication characteristics is investigated. Numerical simulations show a significant enhancement in the pressure field when the minimum film thickness is sufficiently small. This mechanism suggests that viscoelasticity does indeed produce a beneficial effect on lubrication performance, which is consistent with experimental observations.},

We show that the Cox-Voinov law is satisfied and that the effect of a tunable slip length on the substrate is correctly captured. We address, then, the problem of a droplet sliding on an inclined plane, finding that the Capillary number scales linearly with the Bond number, in agreement with experimental results.
